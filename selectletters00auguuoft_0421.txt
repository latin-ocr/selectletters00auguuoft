No, 17 (Ep. ccix)

he was bishop, but by certain others, was found to be
quite unproved, and, apparently cleared of the most
malicious of the imputations made against him, he was
reduced to what we and others thought such a pitiful
state that whatever complaint the town's-people and
those of the district made about his intolerable
tyranny, his rapacity and oppression and abuses of
various kinds, seemed to me by no means so grievous
that, because of it or of all of them put together, we
should reckon it necessary to deprive him of his office
as bishop 3 it seemed enough to make him restore the
things that were proved to have been taken away.

In short, I so tempered my judgement 111111 mercy “
11131 116 was not deprived of office, although his faults
w ere 3 61 1101 left altogether unpunished3 the3 w ere
not of a kind either to be repeated b3 him in the
future or held up to others as a model. In correcting
the young man, 116 11161··61“016 left him his rank unim-
paired, but as a punishment we limited his authority,
so that he should no longer be over those whom he
had treated in such a way that from justified resent-
ment it might have been impossible for them to
endure having him over them at all3 they might
perhaps show their impatience and resentment by
breaking out into some misdeed fraught with danger
to themselves and to him. That this was the state
of their mind even at the time when the bishops were
discussing his case with them appeared very clearly,
although by now the eminent Celer,‘²‘ of whose very
influential interference against him he complained,
exercises no authority either in Africa or anywhere
else.
