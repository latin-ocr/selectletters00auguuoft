No, 26 (Ep. xcix)

good or because you did not want your letter to
sadden me. It does do some good, in my humble
opinion, to know even sad news, first because it is
unfair to be willing to “ rejoice with them that do
rejoice ” and to be unwilling to “ weep with them
that weep‚'’ a and then because “ tribulation worketh
patience, and patience experience, and experience
hope 3 and hope maketh not ashamed, because the
love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost which is given unto US.'' b

Far be it from us, then, to refuse to hear even
the bitter and sorrowful things that befall those who
are very dear to us. For somehow or other what
one member suffers is mitigated if the other members
suffer with it.c But this mitigation of affliction is
effected not by participation in the calamity but by
the consolation love provides, and so, although some
bear the actual burden of sorrow and others share
the burden with sympathetic understanding‚ the
tribulation is yet common to both, since they have
in common the same experience, the same hope, the
same love and the same spirit. But all of us alike
have the consolation of the Lord, who both foretold
these temporal afflictions and promised eternal bless-
ings after them. And he who after the battle
would receive the crown ought not to be broken
in spirit while the battle is on, for He Who prepares
unspeakable gifts for the victors ministers strength
to them when they are engaged in the conflict.

Do not let that reply of mine take away your
confidence in writing to me, especially since you
have had a quite acceptable excuse for soothing
my fears. I return the greetings of your little ones
and pray that they may grow up for you in Christ.
