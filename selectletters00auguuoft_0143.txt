No 10 (Ep. XXIX)

made after many violent persecutions, crowds of
pagans were anxious to come over to the Christian
name but were hindered by the fact that they were
accustomed to spend their feast-days with their idols
in drunkenness and excessive banqueting and could
not easily abstain from those baneful but long-
established pleasures. So our predecessors thought
it good to make concessions for the time being to
those weaker brethren, and to let them celebrate
in honour of the holy martyrs other feast-days, in
place of those they were giving up, unlike them, at

. any rate, in profanation, though like them in excess.

Now that they were bound together by the name of
Christ and submissive to the yoke of His great
authority, they must inherit the wholesome rules of
sobriety, and these they could not oppose because
of their veneration and fear for Him whose rules
they were. It was now high time, therefore, for
such as had not the courage to deny that they were
Christians, to begin to live according to the will of
Christ, casting behind them, now that they were
Christians, the concessions made to induce thern to
become Christians.a
Then Ι urged them to undertake to follow the 10

example of the churches overseas, in some of which
those practices were never admitted, while in others
they had already been corrected by the agency of
good leaders and compliance on the part of the
people.b And as examples of daily excess in drinking
were produced to me from the Church of the blessed
apostle Peter, I stated in the first place that Ι had
heard that they had often been forbidden, but Since

covered when she went to make the customary offerings on
the martyrs’ tombs. See the account in C'onfessz'ons, bk. vi. 2.
