ΝΟ. 10 (Ep. XXIX)

the Lord has enjoined that Christians be recognized
by their fruits, we could ever be so recognized by the
fruits of drunkenness. Ι added that we must read
too the verse that follows, “ But the fruit of the Spirit
is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, good-
ness, saith, meekness, 'teinpei·ance,''a and Ι urged
them to consider how shameful and lamentable it was
that they were not satisfied with practising those
fruits of the flesh at home, but actually wanted to
honour the church with them and, if they were only
allowed, to fill up all the space of a church of this
great size with crowds of banqueters and drunkards 3
yet they would not offer to God the tribute of those
spiritual fruits, to which they were invited both by
the authority of the Holy Scriptures and by our
groam'ngs, and with them rather than any others
celebrate the saints' days.

After that, Ι handed back the manuscript and, 7
being asked to speak‚b I set before their eyes, as far
as I could and as far as the danger itself impelled nie
and the Lord was pleased to afford me strength, our
common danger, theirs, who were entrusted to our
care, as well as ouis, who were to render an account
of them to the Chief Shepherd. Ι implored them by
His humiliation, the unequalled insults, buffetings,
and spitting on the face that He endured, by the blows
on His face ⁰ and His crown of thorns and cross and
blood, to have pity at least for me, if they had any
reason for personal displeasure, and to consider the
inexpressible affection felt for me by the venerable
Senior, Valerius, who for their sakes had not hesitated
to lay upon me the dangerous burden of expounding

hands.” Cf· Vulgate, Matt. xxvi. 67 ‘⁶ alii palmas in faciem
ei dederunt.''
