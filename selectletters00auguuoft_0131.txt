No. 10 (Ep. xxix>

They took this in quite a good spirit, but as 3
the congregation was small, 3 11131161 50 important
demanded further treatment. XVhen my hearers
spread news of my sermon outside, each according
to his ability and point of 11611, 11 found many to
oppose it. But after the morning of Quadragesima
had dawned and a considerable crowd had gathered
at the time of Scripture exposition, we read that
portion from the Grospel where the Lord drove from
the Temple the sellers of animals and 01611111611 1116
1311165 of 1116 money-changers, saying that His
Father's house had been turned from a 1101156 of
prayer into a den of thieves.a After securing their
attention by announcing the subject of drunkenness,
I read that section myself and followed it with an
address designed to show that, if our Lord drove
lawful 113ε16110111 the Temple, since what was sold
was requisite for the sacrifices permitted under that
dispensation‚ He would with much greater indigna-
tion and violence (11116 from it drunken revels, which
are abominable anywhere. And I asked them which
they thought more like 3 (1611 of 11116165, 111056 who
sold necessaries or those who drank beyond measure.

The Scripture readings, turned up beforehand‚ 4
were being held ready to hand up 10 1116, 50 Ι went
on to say that the Jewish people, though yet carnal,
never held even sober feasts, far less drunken ones,
in that Temple in which as yet there was no offering
up of the body and blood of the Lord, and that as a
people they were never found in the Bible b drunk
in the name of religion, unless when they were cele-
brating a feast 10 1116 1(101 they had niade.⁰ So
saying‚ I took the book and read all that passage.
