No. 49 (Ep. CCXI)

remember to make amends at the first opportunity
and heal the wound she has caused ; and the injured
sister must forgive her without further argument.
But if they have caused mutual injury, they will
require to grant mutual pardon because of your
prayers, which from their frequency ought to be
the holier. She who is often tempted by anger and
yet hastens to beg for forgiveness from the sister
whom she acknowledges she has hurt, is better than
she who is slower to anger and is more stubborn in
turning to seek for pardon. As for her who always
refuses to seek for pai-don or who seeks it without
sincerity, she has no reason to be in the monastery,
even if she is not expelled from it. VVherefore, refrain
from harsh words 3 if they fall from your lips, do not
think shame with the same lips that caused the hurt
to utter words of healing. When, however, the needs
of discipline compel the speaking of harsh words for
the controlling of the younger inmates, you are not
required to ask their pardon even if you feel that you
have gone somewhat too far ; otherwise, in observing
too much humility towards those whose duty it is to
be subject to you, you will under-mine your authority
in controlling them. But still you must seek pardon
from the Lord of all, Who knows how great is the
goodwdll and love you have even for those whom you
rebuke, perhaps, with undue severity. The love you
bear each other ought, however, not to be carnal,
but spiritual, for the things that immodest women
do even to other women in low jests and pranks
ought not to be done, not only by widows and chaste
handmaidens of Christ following your holy way of
life, but by Christians at all, be they married women
or maidens destined for marriage.

2 D 401
