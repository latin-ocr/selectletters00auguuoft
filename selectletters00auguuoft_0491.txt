No. 51 (Ep. CCXX)

the virtues you displayed in office, rendered you
the very opposite. The rights or wrongs of that
I personally am unable to examine and deeide;
rather look at and look into your own case, not as it
lies between you and any men, but as it lies, to your
own persona} knowledge, between you and God;
for as you live in Christ as a believer, you ought to
cherish fear of giving offenoe to Him. The cases
that engage my attention are rather those of the
world above, for it is to their own sins that men
ought to attribute the fact that Africa is undergoing
such calamities. Nevertheless, I do not want you
to be of the number of those evil and unrighteous
men whom God uses to scourge with tempora]
punishments those whom He ohooses; since for
the unrighteous themselves, whose evil nature He
justly employs to inflict tempora] evils on others,
He reserves everlasting punishment, if they do not
reform. But as for yourself, fix your mind upon
God, turn your thoughts to Christ, Who has bestowed
such great blessings and endured such great suffer-
ings. Those who desire to attain to His kingdom
and to live udth Him and under Him in everlasting
blessedness, love even their enemies‚ do good to
those who hate them and pray for those who persecute
thema 3 andis at any time in the interests of discipline
they employ irksome severity, they do not, however,
lay aside their sincere affection. If, then, benefits
have been conferred upon you by the Roman Empire,
though they be earthly and transitory b (for that
Empire itself is earthly, and not heavenly, and it can
bestow only what lies within its own power) ; if, then,
benefits have been bestowed upon you, render not
evil for good3 but if evil has been infficted upon
