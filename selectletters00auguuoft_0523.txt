No. 54 (Ep. ccxxxi)

from your lips 3 inform them of this my request, or
rather, if you esteem me highly, consider that my
request is a command 3 in any case, grant my request
or carry out my command : pray for me. Read God's
letters and you will find that the apostles themselves,
the leadersa of the flock, requested this from their
children or enjoined it on their hearers. For myself,
since you make the same request from me for your-
self, He Who answers prayer sees to what extent I am
doing it, and saw to what extent I was doing it even
before ; but in this matter do you show me an equal
return of love. vWe are your overseers, and you are
God’s flock. Refiect and see that our dangers are
greater than yours, and pray for us (for this profits
both us and you) that we may render a good account of
you to the Chief Shepherd b and Head of us all and that
we may likewise escape this world's allurements, more
dangerous than its afflictions, unless when its peace
makes for that for which the apostle warned us to
pray, that is, “that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
life in all godliness and honestys’ ⁶ For if godliness
and honesty be wanting, what is quietness and peace-
ableness from those and the other evils of the world
but an opportunity for sels-indulgence and destruction,
either by inviting to it or by assisting towards it ? So,
then, that we may obtain this ‘⁶ quiet and peaceful life
in all godliness and honesty '’ which my prayers ask
for you, let your prayers ask it for me, wherever you
are, wherever we are 3 for He is everywhere, “ Whose
we are.''‘³l
