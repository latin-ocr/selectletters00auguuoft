TO CELESTINE,⁰ MY REVERED LORD, MY HOLY
BROTHER AND FELLow-DEACON GREATLY
LONGED FOR, AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING
IN THE LORD

I was far away when the clerk Projectus brought the 1
letters your Holiness sent to me at Hippo, yet as soon
as I returned and read them and realized that Ι was
in your debt, I was awaiting a chance of paying my
debt, when lo l the unexpected departure from us of
our well-beloved brother, the acolyte Albinus, has pro-
vided a most welcome opportunity. Rej oicing, there-
fore, in your good health, which is the object of my
earnest desire, I return your Holiness the salutation
I was owing you. But I always owe you love, the
only debt which, after being repaid, still keeps one a
debtor. For it is repaid when it is expended, but is
still owing even if it has been repaid, since there is no
time when it does not require to be expended. Nor
is it lost when it is repaid. but rather by repay-
ment it is multiplied, for it is repaid by retaining
it, not by getting quit of it. And'since it cannot be
repaid unless it be retained, so it cannot be retained
unless it be repaid—nay rather, when a man repays it,

question of grace. Augustine again addresses him in No. 47,
after his elevation to the papal chair.
