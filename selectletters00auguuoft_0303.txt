No 33 (Ep. cxxvi)

of this body of mine, as the people of Hippo are
supposed to have done, but 11116316111118 1116 with
the death of my good reputation, wh ich is surely to
be reckoned more pr ecious than 61611 1116 life of
this body, because of the 116311 brethren, to 11110111
we strive by our conduct, such as it is, to show our-
selves an example of good works.a
Yet, though you do in this way force me 10 take an 9

1116 people of Hippo, for, like men judging other 111611,
even if you believe 1116 11111185 which are not in us,

our beloved fellow-Christians, but also our enemies,
may know without a shadow of a doubt that no lust
for money defiles us in our administration of the
Church's business. Until that happen (if the Lord
grants it to happen), just see, I am doing as a tem-
porary expedient what you force me to do, in order
to avoid the slightest possible delay in soothing your
feelings. God is my witness that it is only because
of the service I owe to the love of my brethren and
the fear of God that I put up with all the administra-
tion of the Church's business over which I am sup-
posed to love the exercise of lordship, and that I have
so little liking for it that I should 111511 10 do without it,
if it could be done without unfaithfulness to my office.
God Himself is my witness that I believe the same to
be quite true about my brother Alypius. Neverthe-
