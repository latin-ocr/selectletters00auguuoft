No. 3 (Ep. §Q-NO. 4 (Ep. xv)

But if human nature does not admit of such a 3
life, why does that calmness of spirit ever befall us ἒ
Why does it befall us more frequently in proportion
as each man worships God in the secret places of his
mind ? Why even amid ordinary mortal concerns
does that peace, as a rule, linger on, when one goes
forth from that inner shrine to do his part ? Why is
it that sometimes, even in conversation, death has no
1611013 for us, and, when conversation is stilled, it even
allures us ? Ι say to you (and I would not say it to
everyone)—I say to you, knowing well, as I do, your
journeyings to the upper world, will you, after fre-
quent experience of the sweet life the soul lives when
it dies to bodily affections, deny that 3 111311’3 whole
life can at length become so exempt from fear that 116
may rightly be called wise ? Or will you venture to
maintain that that state of mind, towards which
reason strives, has ever befallen you, save when you
were communing with your own heart ? This being
30, you 366 11113 0116 thing only 1611131113 for you—to
consider for our mutual advantage how we may live
together. You know much better than Ι (10 what 13
10 be done with your mother 3 in any case your brother
Victor 13 1101 leaving her. I write no more, for fear
of diverting you from consideration of that problem.

Does this letter not show that, if we are short of 1
papyrus, we have at least abundance of parchment ?
The ivory 13111613 Ι possess I have sent to your uncle
with a letter 3 you will the more easily forgive this
