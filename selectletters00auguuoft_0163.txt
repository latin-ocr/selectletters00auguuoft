the critical attitude of a reviewer‚ to any works of
mine that happen to come into your holy hands,
both those on which it was your kind and fatherly
desire that I should try my hand, and any others.
For Ι am fully conscious of God's gifts, and no less
of my own mistakes.

AUGUSTINE TO BROTHER PROFUTURL'S α

In spirit I am well, so far as it is the Lord's good 1
pleasure and as He deigns to grant me strength3
in body, Ι am confined to bed. I can neither walk
nor stand nor sit doun because of the pain and
swelling of piles or tumours.b Yet even so, since
that is the Lord's good pleasure, what else should
I say than that I am well? If we do not like what
pleases Him‚ we ourselves are rather to assume the
blame than to imagine that He is wrong in what He
either does or allows. This is all familiar to you,
but since you are my second self‚ what can Ι say to
you with more pleasure than what I say to myself ?
To your holy prayers then I commend both my
nights and my days 3 pray for me, that I may not
squander my days and that I may endure my nights
with patience 3 pray that even if I walk in the valley
of the shadow of death, the Lord may be with me
that I may sear no evil.c

(exochadium) is a “ pile ” (ἐξοχάς, ἐξοχάδιον). The words are
rare save in the medical writers.
