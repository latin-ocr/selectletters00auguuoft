No. 25 (Ep. XCVII)

son worthy of much honour in the love of Christ, with
all the greater confidence after reading that letter
in which of your own accord you deigned to send us,
even if we were hesitant and backw ard, a 1 ely kind
invitation to use our humble eff01ts to point out to
you how through youi pious obedience, the Lord, by
whose gift you have become what you 316, may at
this juncture come to the assistance of His Church.

And indeed, many of the brethren, my holy col-
leagues, have by reason of the Church’s serious
troubles started out almost as fugitives for the im-

fortunate encounter have received a letter of theirs
from Rome. But for my part, although I was unable
to talk over any plans with them, Ι could not miss the
opportunity provided by this brother and fellow-
priest of mine, who is driven by the urgent peril of a
fellow-citizen to make the journey as best he can,
even though it is mid-winter, to your part of the
world, of greeting and exhorting you by that affec-
tion you have in Christ Ι165115 our Lord, to hasten on
your good work with the most pressing attention.
So shall the enemies of the Church know that those
laws about the demolition of idols and the correction
of heretics, which were sent to Africa while Stilicho a
was still alive, were drawn up at the desire of our
most godly and faithful emperor. They deceitfully
allege or fondly imagine that this action was taken
without his knowledge or against his will, and thus
they incite the mind of the ignorant to the utmost
pitch of violence and to a vehemence of hostility that
is fraught with peril to 115.

Βι11 Ι 3111 quite sure that in submitting this petition
or suggestion for your Eminence’s consideration, Ι
