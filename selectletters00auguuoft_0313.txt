Tberefore let his promise be fulfilled and the heart 14
of the weak brethren be healed‚ so that this notable
precedent may not encourage those who approve of
it to commit similar perj ury, or those who disapprove
of it to say with perfect justice that no one of us is
to be believed, not only on promise of anytffing, but
even on oath. In this connexion we ought rather
to safeguard ourselves against the tongues of our
6116111165, which our greater enemy employs like
darts to slay the weak. But be it far from us to hope
for anything from a soul like his, other than what
the fear of God inspires, and its own great, native
excellence of holiness exhorts. As for myself, you
say I ought actually to have forbidden his oath‚ but
I confess I could not be so minded as to prefer seeing
the church I serve overthrown by such an uproarious
outbreak to accepting the offer made to me by a man
of his standing.
