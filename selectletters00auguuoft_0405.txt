No, 11 (Ep. CXCII)

it increases in him, and the more lavishly he expends
it, the more of it he gains. But how can that be re-
fused to friends which is owing even to enemies ? To
enemies, however, it is paid out with hesitation,
while to friends it is paid back with confidence.
Nevertheless, it makes every possible effort to
recover what it has expended, even from those to
whom it renders good for evil. For we desire to
have as a friend the man whom we truly love as an
enemy, because we do not- love him unless we wish
him good, and that cannot be the case unless he gives
up the evil of enmityf‘

Love, then, is not expended like money, for in 2
addition to the fact that money is diminished by
expenditure and love is increased, they differ in this
too, that we give greater evidence of good-will to-
wards anyone if we do not seek the return of money
we have given him; whereas no one can sincerely
expend love unless he tenderly insist on being repaid;
for when money is received, it is so much gain to the
recipient but so much loss to the donor 3 love, on the
other hand, is not only augmented in the man who
demands it back from the person he loves, even when
he does not receive it, but the person who returns it
actually begins to possess it only when he pay s it back.

Wherefore, my lord and brother, I w illingly repay
to you, and gladly receive back from you, the love w e
owe each other, and that which I receive back, I still
claim· , that which I repay, I still owe. For it is our
duty in all teachableness to hearken to our one Master,
before Whom we are fellow-pupils, when He speaks
