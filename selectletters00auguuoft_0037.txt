with the Roman conqueror. It was among these
peoples that the earliest successes of the Church had
been achieved3 missionary enterprise had begun in
the coastal towns and followed the Roman roads in-
land, but the first Christians were recruited from the
lower classes, as were later the majority of the converts
to monasticism. Now the victorious Church, through

its members, acquired or inherited vast tracts of land
and became itself a proprietor and employer, bound
to the same system of exploitation as had character-

who were Christians compelled their dependents to
accept the saith, on the principle czy'us regio, ejus

their land for the use of their workers. The bishops
obtained judicial privileges which, if they added
enormously to their labour, added no less to their
prestige. Following more or less closely the civil
boundaries, the Church had organized its dioceses
into the six provinces into which Diocletian had
divided North Africa: Proâ€”consular Africa had its
metropolis at Carthage, Numidia at Cirta, Byzacenum
at Hadrumetum, Tripolitana at Tripoli, the two
Mauretanias at Sitifis and Caesarea. A clue to the
nature of the Christian population is supplied by the
interesting phenomenon of an unusually numerous
episcopate : practically every important town had its
own bishop, and not a few of the manorial churches
besides, In the course of the fourth century there
are no fewer than seven hundred bishoprics, and even
admitting that roughly one half of these were due to
Donatist rivalry, the remainder is still disproportion-
