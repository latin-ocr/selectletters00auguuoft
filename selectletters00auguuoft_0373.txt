ΝΟ. 41 (Ep. CLXXIX)

saying to the apostle Peter, “ Ι have prayed for thee,
that thy saith fail not‚'' a if all this receives its fulfil-
ment in us without any help from God, but by the
power of our will alone.)

So these perverted and sacrilegious arguments not 4
only give the lie to our prayer-s, in which we ask
the Lord for anything that we read and believe that
the holy have asked‚ but also are in conflict m’th the
benediction we give, when over the people we utter
the prayer and petition to God that He will “ make
them to increase and abound in love one towards
another and towards all men,'' b and “ grant them ac-
cording to the riches of His glory to be strengthened
with might by his Spirit‚'’ ⁶ and “ fill them with joy and
peace in believing and make them to abound in hope
and in the power of the Holy Spirit.'’ d (Why do we ask
these things for them which we know the apostle
asked from the Lord for the nations‚ if even now
our nature, created with free-will, can provide all of
them for itself by its own will ? And why does this
same apostle say too, “ For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God,'' ⁶ if we
are led by the spirit of our nature to be made the
sons of God ? And why does he likewise say, “ The
Spirit helpeth our infirmities‚'’f if our nature is created
such that it does not need any help from the Spirit
to do the works of righteousness? And why does
Scripture say, “But God is faithful, who will not
suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,
but will with the temptation also make a way to
escape, that ye may be able to bear it‚'' 9 if we have
been created such that by the strength of our free-
will we are able to overcome all temptations by
simply enduring them Β)
