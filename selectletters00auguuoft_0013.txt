PREFACE

Goldbacher, the veteran editor, whom Ι knew only
in the last, difficult years of his long and devoted
life, but who was even then unwearied in labour
and in helpfulness3 and, last but not least, Pro-
fessor Alexander Souter‚ of Aberdeen University‚
with whom my friendship during the last twelve
years has been an interrupted, but happy, record of
“ patristic hours,” fruitful and stimulating to a degree
which those who know him as a scholar and a friend
will readily understand.
