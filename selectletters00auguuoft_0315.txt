ΝΟ. 34 (Ep. CXXXHI)

party whom the guardians of public order had taken
from Hippo to be tried for their misdeeds, have been
heard, Ι 3111 informed, by your Excellency, and the
majority of them have confessed to having murdered
Restitutus, a Catholic priest, and beaten Innocentius,
another Catholic priest, and gouged out his eye and
cut off a finger. This news has plunged me into the
deepest anxiety, lest perchance your Highness may
decide that they must endure a legal sentence so
sev ere that their punishment shall be similar m kin d
to their crime. For that reason I implore 1 ou b3 the
saith you 11316 111 Christ, by the mercy of Chiist the
Lord Himself, neither to do this nor to let it be done
at all. For although we can disclaim responsibilit3
for the death of men who were clearly made to ap—
pear before the court on no accusation of ours, but
on the indictment of those officers who were concerned
with the safe-guarding of the public peace, still it is
not our desire that the sufferings of God's servants
shall be avenged by the infliction of similar punish-
ments, as if b3 wa3 of retaliation3 not that we refuse
to 311011 wicked men to be depri3 ed of impunit3
in 0111116, but that we rather desire that justice be
satisfied in such a 33a3 as to turn the 33icked b3
means of coerci3·e measures from their mad frenzy
to the peaceableness of sane men, without taking
their life or crippling them in any part of the body,
and so set them to some useful work instead of
their works of malice. That too is called a penal
sentence, but who can fail to see that it 15 10 be termed
rather a benefit than a punishment, when, on the one
side, bold and frenzied violence is not allowed a free
hand, and, on the other, the remedy of repentance
is not withheld ?
