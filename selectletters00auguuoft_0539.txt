Nc. 55 (Ep. ccxxxn)

Awake at last from your slumbers, ye men of 7
Madaura, my brethren and my fathers 1 a This
opportunity of writing to you has been furnished me
by God. As far as was possible, I stood by and
gave my assistance, as God willed, in this affair of
brother Florentius, who brought your letter to me 3
but the affair was such that even without my aid
it could very easily have been carried through, for
almost all the men of that family who are at Hippo
know Florentius and deeply lament his bereavement.
But your having sent a letter to me made it not
presumptuous in me to write to you and, availing
myself of the opportunity you provided, to say some-
thing to idolâ€”worshippers about Christ. But I beseech
you, if your naming of Him in your letter was not a
vain gesture, that what I have written to you may
not be in vain. If you wanted to make mock of me,
fear Him Who on being at first condemned was made
mock of by the proudU w orld, which now aw aits Him
in subjection as Judge. For my heart' s desiie for
you, expressed as well as I could m these pages, u 11]
be a witness against you at His judgement, when
He will confirm those who belee in Him and
confound those who do not. May the one true
God free you from all the vanity of this world, my
praiseworthy lords and well-beloved brethren, and
turn you to Himself.
