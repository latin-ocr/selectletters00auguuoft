II

The controversy between Augustine and Pelagius,
in the course of which were evol-ved those theories of
Grace, Predestination, and Freewill speci fically desig-
nated Augustinianism, occupies a relatively small space
in the present collection of letters, for the majority of
those in which Augustine sets forth his own views or
discusses the theories of his opponents are either too
lengthy or too technical for our purpose here. Yet in
many ways it was the most important of the ecclesias-
tical questions with which Augustine was engaged,
and the one into which he threw himself with the
most fervour and conviction. His controversy with
the Manichaeans concerning the nature of evil had
aheady turned his attention to the problem of sin, its
sway over the human heart, and its punishment, and
the writings he had circulated on the subject had
marked him out as a leader of Christian thought.
Moreover, it was a phrase from his own Confessions .·
Da quod iubes et iube quod vis (Bk. x. 40, 44, 60) to
which Pelagius originally took exception, and it was in
Africa that the new doctrines first took hold and were
first conCemned. When Pelagianism spread to the
various cc untries around the Mediterranean, it was
to Augustine that all men turned in hope of defini-
tion in a problem which affected every Christian in
his attitude towards evil and towards the salvation
offered by the Church in Christ as a deliverance from
evil. The dispute here concerned man as a more im-
mediate and inward aspect of the problem which had
earlier engaged Augustine’s mind3 with the Mani-
chaeans the discussion had centred round the meta-
physica] and cosmological problem, evil as it existed
