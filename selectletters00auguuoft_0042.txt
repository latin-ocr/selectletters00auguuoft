INTRODUCTION

Donatism 3 a smaller number treat of paganism,
and several others discuss such matters as church
discipline, the right of sanctuary, and monasti-
cism. Most of the purely personal letters have been
relegated by the editors, because of the difficulty of
dating them, into the fourth section (Epp. ccxxxii.—

the moment neither papyrus nor tablets were avail-
able : his ivory tablets he had sent to the uncle of his
correspondent and he asks for their speedy return.
His habit was to dictate to scribes 3 ὓ 1101 seldom at

lessness of copyists has considerably reduced the
