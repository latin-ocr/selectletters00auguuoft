No. 11 (Ep. XXXIV)

public officials that the priest Victor received from
his bishop, or whether, since Victor himself has
denied it, they have fathered a lie upon him in the
public documents, although they belong to the same
religious body. Otherwise, if he‘ agrees that we
should without heat discuss the whole question at
issue between us to the end that the error, which is
already clear, may be more clearly brought to light,
I gladly embrace the opportunity. Ι have heard of
his proposal that without any popular uproar we
should examine what is true according to the Scrip-
tures, in the presence of ten weighty and honourable
men from each side. That alternative proposal,
which some reported to me as his, that Ι should
go to Constantine,a since his followers were more
numerous there, or that Ι ought to go to Milevis,b
because there, people say, they are going to hold a
council soon, it is absurd to make, as if any particular
charge concerned me except the church of Hippo.
The whole issue of this inquiry lies between me
and Proculianus above all, but if he considers him-
self unequal to it, let him implore the aid of any
colleague of his that he chooses. For in other towns
we deal with matters concerning the Church only so
far as the bishops of those towns, our brethren and
fellow-priests, allow us or enj oin upon us.
And yet, I do not quite see what he, who proclaims 6

himself a bishop of such long standing, is afraid of
in a novice such as Ι am, to shrink from a conference

form of the name varies, the inscriptions having Milev
(indeclinable). Optatus, author of a work against the
Donatists, was a bishop there, and it was the birthplace of
the Donatist Faustus against whom Augustine wrote the
Contra Faustum.
