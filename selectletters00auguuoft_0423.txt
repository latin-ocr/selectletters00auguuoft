No. 17 (Ep. cclx)

for your piety and holy father revered with all due
affection, and give orders that all the documents sent
you be read to you. See how he conducted himself
in his office as bishop, how, when deprived of com-
munion until after everything had been restored to
the people of Fussala, he so far accepted our decision,
then later set aside a sum in compensation for the
things, quite apart from the legal decision, so that
he might regain the privilege of communion3 see
too with what crafty persuasion he led the holy
Senior, that very excellent man our Primate, to
believe all his statements and to recommend him to
the revered Pope Boniface as one in ev e13 1131
blameless. What need 15 there for me to rehearse all
the rest, since the 161161 31)16 Senior afore- mentioned
11111 have reported the affair to your Holiness in 311
its details ?

From the numerous minutes, however, that contain 7
our judgement upon him, Ι should rather fear to
appear to you less severe in judging him than I ought
to have been, if I did not know that you are so prone
to mercy as to reckon it your duty to spare the man
himself and us as well for sparing him. But what we
did, either from kindness or from carelessness, he is
now trying to turn to account and employ as a legal
objection. His cry is, “ Either I ought to be sitting
in my own episcopal chair or else Ι ought not to be a
bishop at all,'' as if he were now sitting in any chair a
but his own. For it was for this very reason that
those districts in which he was bishop before were
set apart and set under his care that he might not
be said to have been illegally transferred to another

the word came to mean the building in which the bishop's
throne stood.
