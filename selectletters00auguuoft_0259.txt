But the sixth book, which I have found in a 4

others, and I am sending it to your Charity at once 3
it perhaps will not so markedly shrink from the atten-

Julian, to be worth reading or knowfflg, since he

Of him Ι dare not say that he is dearer to me than
you are, for it would not be true to say that, but still I
do dare to say that I long for him more than I do for
you. It may seem strange how I long for him more,
for Ι love you both equa11y3 but this is the result
of the greater hope I have of seeing him, for I think
that if you were to send him or bid him come to me,
he would both be doing what a young man should
do, especially when he is not yet hindered by heavier
responsibilities‚ and he would the more speedily bring

Ι have not mentioned the nature of the verse in
which the Psalms of David are composed, because I
do not know, for the translator from the Hebrew
tongue‚ which is unknown to me, could not reproduce
thet> verse, for fear of being compelled by the needs
of metre to depart from accuracy in his translation
farther than was consistent with the meaning. But
that they are composed ln a definite metre I believ e on
the authority of those who have a thorough knowledge
of that language3 for that holy man loved sacred
music, and he more than any other writer kindled in
me a zeal for its study.

May you all ‘⁶ dwell ” for evermore “ in the secret
