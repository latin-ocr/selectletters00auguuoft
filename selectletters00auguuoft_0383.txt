No. 11 (Ep. CLXXIX)

later could be sinless 3 for he declares he did not state
that anyone would be found who from infancy to old
age had not committed sin, but that after turning
from sin by his own effort and with the help of God's
grace, he could live without sin. For when he says
‘⁴ turning from sin,'' he shows that the earlier part of
life was lived in sin. Let him then admit that Abel
did 5111, 511166 1115 early life was lived in the world, and
it, according to his admission, is not without sin ; and
let him take another look at his own book, where it
is quite plain 116 did make the statement which in this
defence he denies having made.‘²
But if he asserts that this book, or this passage in 10

the book, is not from his pen, I on my side 11316
adequate 11111165565, 111611 of honour and reliability
and undoubted friends of his own, and I can acquit
myself by their testimony that they handed this same
book to me containing that sentence and that they
declared it was from the pen of Pelagius ; that 611-
dence at any rate is sufficient to deter anyone from
saying that it was written or fabricated by me. Now
among these let each man choose whom to believe.
It is not my business to discuss the matter at any
greater length. I ask you to convey to him by a sure
hand, if he denies that those are his opinions, the
points to which objection is taken as being in con-
flict with the grace of Christ. So plausible is his de-
fence, indeed, that we shall rejoice with exceeding
joy if he has not deceived your wise Holiness, un-
acquainted as you are with his other xwitings, by any

he gives two alternatives: either Abel was not sinless in
character, even if he did no sinful deed, or else he turned
from sin—in either case, therefore, he was not without the

taint of original sin which Pelagius is seeking to deny.
