all the better equipped. In the last resort, my
brother and colleague, Samsucius‚ bishop of the
Church of Turres? is here, and he has acquired no
such learning as your man is said to be afraid of 3
let him come and conduct it with him. I shall ask
him, and I trust in the name of Christ he will readily
agree to undertake to be my substitute in this.
Though he is without any grace of eloquence, yet
he is learned in the true saith, and the Lord will
help him, I feel sure, in his contest for the truth.
There is then no reason why he should refer me
to any others, instead of settling between ourselves
a matter which concerns ourselves. But still, as I
said before, Ι do not decline to meet those others, if
he himself demands their aid.
