No. 52 (Ep. ccxxvii)

danger. That pra3 er 11 as granted. but in spite of
that he neglected to fulfil his 1011.Β111 his ha1d

blindness and it immediately occurred to him why
that had happened. He cried out, confessing 1115
fault, and made another vow that, if he received back

bene reddiderunt, habent spatium, teneant ; quia die sabbati
audientibus omnibus qui aderunt reddituri estis, die sabbati

novissimo, quo die baptizandi estis ”).
