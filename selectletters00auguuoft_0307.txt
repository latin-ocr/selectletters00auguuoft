No. 33 (Ep. cxxvi)

many demands upon us, such as I do not think they
in their day endured, would altogether prevent us. So
in this matter let no further reproach of the base lust
for money be made against the Christian people who
constitute the Church of God. It is more tolerable
that it should be made against us,for on us suspicion of
that sin could fall, though without ground, yet not with-

yet when they take an oath to each other, we praise
those 33⁷ ho keep their w ord and rightly execrate those
who break it. W hat impelled them to take an oath‚
