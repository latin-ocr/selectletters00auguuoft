No. ρ (Ep. 111

Ι (10, 11131 Ι had,<1 in discriminating between nature as
perceived by the 5611565 and as known to the intellect.
I think, however, 3⁷ou are not unaware that, if one
becomes more thoroughl3⁷ enmeshed in false opinions
the more (1661111Υ 311(1 familiai-13⁷ one wallows in them,

the same happens much more ieadjl3 to the mind in
things that are real M3p1ogress 15 gradual, like
the ad3 3066 of age. There is a 3⁷er3 great differ-

ence between 3 bo3⁷ and 3 mature 11130, 3 61 110 0116, if
asked each da3⁷ from bo3 hood 00, 33 ill 31 an3⁷ gi3 en
time declare that he 1135 reached 0131111111.

Ι don't want 3ou ’(0 take this 10 1116311 3ou are 2
10 assume 11131, through 1116 3igour of 3 111016 robust
understanding. Ι ha3 6 31131116(1 m such matters a kind
of mental maturity. Ι 301 51111 1116013111* 3 bo3⁷· , let
us hope 3 fine, strapping 0116, 35 1116 phrase goes, but
Ι 310 1101 badly off 6111161.ὸ For generaII3, when I arn
unsettled and oppressed 33ith the anxieties arising
from the impingement of 561153110115, Ι 3111 raised to a
fresher atmosphere b3⁷ this brief reasoning, which 3⁷ou
know so well: “The mind and understanding are
superior 10 1116 6165 and the common facult3⁷ of sight.
That would not be 50, unless the things we conceive
were more real 11130 111056 we percei3·e.'' Please
examine with me whether there 116 an3thing that
strongly conflicts with this 1106 of reasoning. For the
present I find it stimulating 3 3et, when Ι have asked
God’s help and have begun to 1156 towards Him and
towards those things that 316 01051 really 1631, Ι am
sometimes filled 33ith such a foretaste of the things
that abide‚ 11131 Ι occasionally 33 onder at m3 needing
the help of 11115 reasoning to 11611616 in the existence
of those things that are 35 1631 within me 35 an3 man
can be to himself.
