TO THE LADIES PROBA AND JULIANAJ MOST
NOBLE IN RANK, DAL'GHTERS JL'STLY DIS-
TINGL'ISHED AND EMINENT, AUGL’STINE
SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

You have filled my hear’c with joy, the more
delightful because of your affection, and the more
welcome because of your promptitude. For while
'the consecration of a daughter of your house to the
life of virginity is being proclaimed by busy rumour
wherever your fame is known, and that is everywhere,
you outstripped its speediest ssight by the surer and
more trustworthy information in your letter and
made us exult at ’che news of so very excellent a
blessing before we had time 'co doubt the rumour
of it. What words are adequare 'co tell, what com-
mendation worthy to commemorate, how incompar-
ably greater is the glory and ’che gain, that Christ
should have women from your family dedicated to
virginity than that the world should have nien from
it elevated to ’the consulship? For if it is a great
and notable thing to leave the mark of an honoured
name upon the scrolls of time, how much greater and
more notable it is by unsullied innocence of mind and
body to rise above them l So let this maiden, noble in

ascetic: J erome wrote to Demetrias a very lengthy letter

which is almost a treatise on the ascetic life, and Pelagius

too wrote a long epistle‚ Ad Demetriadem, into which he

insinuated some of his own errors, which Augustine sought

ΒΟ lconfu'te in a later letter (Ep. chfflxviii.) addressed to
u lana.
