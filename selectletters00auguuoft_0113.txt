ΝΟ. 8 (Ep. XXII)

counsels of this kind, either because your own re-
flection has suggested a richer stoi-e of beneficial
principles, or else because your Holiness has passed
the stage of requiring remedies of this kind. My
purpose in writing as Ι have done is to make you aware
of my vices and to let you know what, in view of my
weakness, you might ask God for. I beseech you by
the humanity of Him who has laid down the rule that
we should bear each other's bm·dens‚a to do this most
earnestly. There is much in my life and conduct
that I deplore, but I should prefer that it should not
reach you by letter3 between my heart and your
heart there should be no intermediary save my
mouth and your ears. If our venerated Senior,
Saturninus, whom we all regard with very genuine
affection, and whose really brotherly kindness and
concern for you Ι saw when I was with you, will deign
to visit us when he sees it convenient, any conversa-
tion I may have with that holy and warni—hearted
and spiritually—minded man will be little, if any,
different from what Ι might have with your Graee.
With entreaties that surpass all expression I urge you
to be good enough to join me in asking and obtaining
a visit from him. The people of Hippo are much afraid,
indeed excessively so, to let me go so far away from
them, and they are in no wise willing to trust me, as I
trust you.

Before your letter reached me, I learned through
our saintly brother and fellow-servant, Parthenius,
of the ground provided for our brethren by your fore-
thought and generosity. He gave us besides much
news that we were anxious to have. The Lord will
grant the fulfilment of the other things also for which
we are still anxious. ’
