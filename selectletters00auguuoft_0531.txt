ΝΟ. 55 (Ep. ccxxxii>

experienee and hand down to our posterity, that
Holy Scripture has not spoken of, as far as it 1101131115
to the seeking and the holding of true religi0n3
everything 0011105 10 11355 exaetly as it was foretold
it would come to pass. You plainly see the Jewish
people torn from their abode and disper-sed and
scattered throughout almost the whole world, the
origin of that people and its development and the
loss of its realm and its dispersion everywhere——
everything has happened just as it was foretold.
You plainly 500 11131 1110 word of God and the law
that came forth from that same people 1111011011 Christ
(Who was 1111130111011511 110111 of them) 1135 laid fast
hold upon the faith of 311 1110 01110115, 311 111050
things, 35 110 11131 read, 11010 111οε1101οᾶ just 35 110
500 1110111. You plainly see 1113111 0111 off from 1110
root of the Christian 5001011,11111011 through the 5005
of the apostles and the succession of 1115110115 15 spread
abroad in unmistakable diffusion throughout the
world, who yet 110351, under cover of the Christian
name, of the mere outward likeness they bear to
their origin, like withered branches, which we term
heresies and schisms3 it was all foreseen, foretold and
put down in writing. You plainly see some of the
temples of idols fallen into ruin and not restored, some
cast down, some closed, some converted to other 11505,α
and the idols themselves either smashed to 1110005 01
1111111οᾱ 01 destroyed3 and you see how the powers of
this world, who at one time for the sake of their
idols persecuted the Christian people, are vanquished
and subdued by Christians who did not take up
arms but laid down their lives, and have now turned

temples] in melius convertuntur, alia diruuntur atque fran-
guntur, alia in meliores usus commutantur.'’
