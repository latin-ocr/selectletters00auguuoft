No. 39 (Ep. CLXXIII)

are angry because you are being dragged to salvation,
although you and your friends have dragged so many
of our people to destruction. What other intention
have we, but to arrest you and bring you before the
judge and preserve you from perishing? As for the fact
that you received a slight bodily injury, you are to
blame for that yourself, for you would not make use
of the mule that was at once brought for you, and
dashed yourself with violence to the ground 3 for, as
you know, the other person who was taken away
With you, a colleague of yours, arrived uninjured,
since he did not cause any such injury to himself.
But even that, in your opinion, should not have 2

been done to you, for you hold that no one should
be forced to what is good. Mark the words of the
Apostle, “If a man desire the office of bishop, he
desireth a good work,'' a yet in spite of them, many
men are led to undertake the office of bishop only
by being detained against their will, brought from
one place to another, shut up and kept under super-
vision, subj ected to treatment that they do not like,
until they acquire a willingness to undertake that
“ good work.'' ᾖ How much more fitting it is that you
should be torn away from that pernicious error, by
clinging to which you are your own worst enemies,
and brought to either a knowledge or acceptance
of the truth, so that you may not only retain your
honour with safety to yourselves, but also escape the
great misery of destruction. You say that God has
given man free—will and that therefore no one should
be forced even to good. Why then are those men
I spoke of above compelled to good? Mark well
then a point you refuse to take into consideration:
the reason why a good will expends itself in works
