TO MY MOST SAINTLY LORD, MY VENERABLE
AND LONGED FOR BROTHER AND FELLOW·
PRIEST, EVODIUS b AND THE BRETHREN
WHO ΑΗΕ WITH YOU, AUGUSTINE AND
THE BRETHREN WHO ΑΗΕ WITH ΜΕ SEND
GREETING IN THE LORD

The brother who brings this, Barbarus by name, 1
is a servant of God who has been settled for a long
time now at Hippo and is an eager and diligent
hearer of the word of God. He besought this letter
from me to your Holiness, in which Ι commend him
to you in the Lord and through him offer you my
due greetings. To reply to your Holiness’s letter,
into Which you have woven big questions, is a very
considerable undertaking even for men of leisure‚
possessing much more skill in argument and greater
acuteness of understanding than I do. Of the two
letters from you, containing many extensive queries,
Tagaste, he had been converted shortly before him, and the
two were in close fellowship at Milan and Cassiciacum‚
where he appears as interlocutor with Augustine in the De
Quantitate Animae and the De Libero Arbitrio. After being
present at Ostia when Monnica died, Evodius returned to
Africa with Augustine and shared the monastic life of
Tagaste. Four letters from him to Augustine are extant,
full of abstruse questions. The present letter is a reply to
one of his, Ep. clxxxviii„ Which had raised the problem

of the reality and meaning of visions. Of Barbarus, the
bearer of the letter, there is no other mention.
