ΝΟ. 28 (Ep. CI)

philosophers themselves, who were either completely
without knowledge of God or else, “when they
knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, neither
were thankful, but became vain in their imagina-
tions, and their foolish heart was darkened3 profess-
ing themselves to be wise they became fools, and
changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an
image made like to corruptible man and to birds
and four-footed beasts and creeping things,’'‘² or who,
though not given, or not excessively given, to such
images, yet “worshipped and served the creature
more than the Creator.'' b Far be it, therefore, from
us rightly to give the name of liberal studies to
the lying conceits and follies, the empty trifles and
complacent misrepresentations of those unhappy
men who djd not recognize the grace of God
through our Lord J esus Christ, by which alone we
are delivered ‘⁵ from the body of this death,'' ⁶ even in
those things which they felt to be true. Their his-
torica] works, whose writers claim to be especially
reliable in their narratives, contain something perhaps
that may fitly be learned by the free, since what
they narrate, whether the fortunes or the mis-
fortunes of mankind, is at any rate true. And yet,
I completely fail to see how men who were without
the assistance of the Holy Spirit, and were com-
pelled by the xeiy nature of human infirmity to
gather mere rumours together, u ere not in their
search for sacts mistaken in most of them. Yet
in such writings there is an approximation to
liberty, prow'ded that the writers have no intention
of deceiving and do not mislead men, except in so
far as they themselves, through human infirmity, are
misled by their informants.
