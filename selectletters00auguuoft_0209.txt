Excellency by means of this epistolary converse the
anxieties arising from my controversies. For in pro—
portion as we have been gladdened by the surprising
success of your measures in favour of catholic unity
throughout the other parts of Afric-a, so do we regret,
my distinguished lord and son truly and deservedly
honoured and cherished in Christ’s love, that the
district of Hippo Regius and the territories adjoining
it on the borders of Numidia have not yet been
honoured with the vigorous support of your edict as
governor. I 11336 thought it better to mention 11115
fact to your Excelleney‚ 50 that it may not be
attributed rather to negligenee 011 my part, since
I bear the burden of episcopal office at Hippo. If
you condescend to 3566113111 from my brethren and
oolleagues‚ who 316 111 3 position to recount the facts
to your High1,1ess 01 from the priest. whom I am
sending with this letter, how far the 116161165 have had
the boldness and effrontery to go in this same region
of Hippo. I am confident 3 011 33111, w ith the help of the
Lord our G0d‚ take steps to have this puffed- up
irreverence and conceit healed by methods tending to
discourage it rather than cut away by measures that
are purely retaliatory.
