No, 8 (Ep. XXII)

what is being said against him is untrue ἲ Τ116 pain
of receiving such treatment would certainly not 161111

ing his bones.'' I have every confidence in your
strength of mind, so what I am discussing with you
I am applying to myself3 still, you are good enough,
Ι think, to consider with me how serious and difficult
3 11131161 11113 is. Only one who 1133 1166131611 war 011
11131 foe realizes 1113 power, for, although it 13 easy to
do without praise, when it 13 denied us, it is hard not
to take pleasure in it, when it 13 offered. And yet
our minds ought to be 30 completely uplifted to God
that, if we are undeservedly praised, we may correct
those we can, 1631 they should think we possess gifts
that 316 1101 01113, 01 11131 1116 gifts we have from God
are 0111 own, or praise qualities 116 do 11033633 and
even possess in 3 marked degree, but which 316 111
110 way matters for praise, for example 311 111036
advantages we share with 3111111313 or with unchristian
111611. Β111 if we are deservedly praised for God‘s sake,
we should congratulate those who find pleasure in
what is truly good, and not ourselves for pleasing
men, and that only if we are in the eyes of God what
they take us to be and offer the praise not 10 113, 11111
10 God 3 for everything that is truly and deservedly
praised is 3 gift from Him. This is what I keep on
saying to myself each day, 01 rather He does, from
whom come whatever salutary counsels 316 found
in Scripture readings or are suggested to the mind
from within. Yet, strenuously as I struggle with the
adversary, I often receive wounds from him, since I
cannot rid myself of delight in the praise that is
offered me.
