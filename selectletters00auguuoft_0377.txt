No. 41 (Ep. CLXXIX>

For that reason it is written, “ For as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive,'' a not that
no one will be damned, but that no one will be de-
livered in any other way ; for just as all those who are
children of men are so through Adam, so 311 those
who are children of God are so through Christ. So
all children of men are able to become such only
through Adam, and all of them who have become
children of God, only through Christ. Let him
therefore openly express his views on this further
point, whether he accepts the fact that even little
children, who have not y et reached the stage of
willing righteousness or of refusing it, y et because of
one man, by w hom“ sin enter ed into 1116 world, and
death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for
that all have sinned,'' b are delivered by the grace of
Christ—whether even for them, because of original
sin, he believes that the blood of Christ was shed,
which was, to be sure, shed for the remission of sins.⁶
About these points in particular I am anxious to know
what he believes and holds, what he definitely con-
165565 and preaches. In the other points, however,
that are raised against him, even if 116 116 proved to be
in error, none the less until he accepts correction, it is
more tolerable to bear with him.

Further, I beg you to have the kindness to send to
me the minutes of the Church council d which declare
him to be cleared of the charge of heresy. This I beg
at the desire of manv bishops who 11316, like 1116,
116611 troubled by the indefinite rumour about this;
I have written, 11011 ev er, asking 11115 111 my own name
for the reason that I did not 11 ant to miss the oppor-
tunity of the messenger, w ‘’ho 15 111 3 position, I under-
stand, to return to us speedily. In place of these
