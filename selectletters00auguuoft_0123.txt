ΝΟ. 9 (Ep. XXVIII)

vain ; yea, and we are found false witnesses of God,
because we have testified of God that He raised up
Christ3 whom He raised not up '' α ? If anyone should
say to him : “ What is it in this 116 11131 shocks you,
when, even if what you say is untrue, it very greatly
redounds to the glory of God? ’' would he not denounce
the madness of such a suggestion and with every
available word and sign open to the light the inmost
secrets of his 116311, declaring that to praise falsehood
in God was no less 3 3111, perhaps even a much greater
one, than to 6331 aspersion upon His truth ? An
effort must be made to bring to a knowledge of
the sacred Scriptures 3 111311 who will have such
a reverent and truthful opinion of the holy books
that he would refuse to find delight in a well-meant
falsehood anywhere in them, and would rather pass
over what he does not understand than prefer his
own intelligence to their truth. For indeed when
he expresses such a preference, he demands credence
for himself and attempts to destroy our confidence
in the authority of the holy Scriptures.

For my part I would use all the strength the Lord ⁷
supplies to show that all those texts that are adduced
to prove the expediency of falsehood ought to be
understood in another sense, so that everywhere their
unimpeachable veracity might be made apparent.
For just as texts ought not to be lies in themselveS‚
so they should lend no support to lies. But Ι leave
this matter to your own intelligence 3 if you apply a
more attentive consideration to the reading of them,
you will perhaps see this more easily than I do. To
that consideration you will be compelled by the
reverent spirit that makes you recognize that the
authority of the holy Scriptures becomes unsettled,
