ΝΟ. 39 (Ep. CLXXIII)

of mercy is to provide guidance for man's evil will.
For who does not know that man is not damned
unless fora his evil will, nor, on the other hand,
granted deliverance, unless he has a good will?
Stillb it does not follow that those we love are to be
cruelly left to enj oy their evil will without correction,
but where the power is granted, they are to be both
prevented from evil and forced to good.

For if an evil will is always to be left to enjoy its 3
liberty, why were such severe scourges employed to
prevent the disobedient and querulous Israelites from
evil and to compel them to the land of promise Ρ ⁰ If
an evil will is always to be left to enjoy its liberty,
why was Paul not allowed the free use of his per-
verted will to persecute the Church, but was thrown
to the ground to be blinded, and blinded to be trans-
formed, and transformed to be made an apostle, and
made an apostle to endure for the truth sufferings
such as he had inflicted when in error ? d If an evil
will is always to be left to enjoy its liberty, why do
the Holy Scriptures admonish a father not only to
correct his obstinate son with rebukes, but also to
punish his body with blows, so that, compelled and
subdued, he may be led to habits of goodness ? e That
is why the same writer says, “ Thou shalt beat him
with a rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.'' s If
an evil will is always to be left to enjoy its liberty,
why are careless pastors rebuked with the words,
“ Ye have not brought back the wandering sheep,
ye have not sought that which was lost '²9 Ρ You too
