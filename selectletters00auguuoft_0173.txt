No. 15 (Ep. XLVIII>

neither to the right hand nor to the left-3⁹ a For there
are some who, over-afraid of being snatched up and
borne, as it were, to the right hand, slip and sink
down upon the left 3 and there are some again who,

his fiery darts,'’ ⁶³ or ‘⁶ singing and making melody to

with your heart: ‘⁶ do all to the glory of God,9 who
worketh all in all‚'' h and be so ‘⁶ fervent in spirit '’ 2'
