⁷ NO. 42 (Ep. CLXXXIX)

upon it. This letter, then, may rather serve as a
mirror to you, in which you can behold what manner
of man you are, rather than as a lesson to you what
manner of man you ought to be. And yet, whatever
you find either in this letter or in Holy Scripture that
you still lack for a good life, be instant in prayer and
in deeds, so that you may acquire it 3 and from what
you have, render thanks to God as the fount of good-
ness, from VVhom you have received it, and in all
your good deeds ascribe the glory to God and the
humility to yourself, for, as it is written, ‘⁴ Every
good and perfect gift is from above and cometh down
from the Father of lights.''‘¹ Yet whatever progress
you make in the 1016 of God and of your neighbour
and in genuine godliness, do not imagine that you
are without sin, as long as you are in this life, con-
cerning which 116 read in Holy Writ, “ Is not the
h‘fe of man upon earth 3 life of temptation ? ”b And
so, since it is necessary for you, as long 35 you are in
this body, always to say in prayer what the Lord
taught us, “ Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our
debtors,'’ ⁰ remember quickly to forgive anyone who
has sinned against you and has asked for pardon, so
that you may be able to pray with sincerity and
succeed in obtaining pardon for your own sins.

I have 111111611 111656 exhortations to you, my dear
friend, in haste, as the haste of the bearer compelled
me, but I render thanks to God that I have in some
degree been able to comply with your holy desire.
May the mercy of God always be your protection,
my noble lord and deservedly distinguished and

honourable son 1
