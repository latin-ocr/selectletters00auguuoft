find no heavier punishment, if you were angry and
wanted to punish me, than what I have been endur-
ing at not seeing you at Tagaste. But I hope that
by the help of your prayers it may be granted me
as soon as possible to pay you a visit, when this
emergency that now detains me is past, wherever in
Africa you may be, if this city that is the scene of
my labours be unworthy, as I myself do not venture
to consider it worthy, to share with me the joy of
your presence.

TO THE HOLY LADY AND THE REVERED HAND-
MAID OF GOD, ΑΕΒΙΝΑ,α AUGUSTINE SENDS
GREETING IN THE LORD

people of Hippo djd nothing to make our holy brother,
your son Pinianus, apprehensive of death, even
though he himself perhaps entertained some fear of
it. We ourselves, indeed, were afraid that some of
the ruffians who often mix with a crowd from some

oath, which Augustine held to be valid‚ and repudiating the
charge of covetousness. When Pinianus lost his property,
the Hipponiensians quietly let the matter drop.
