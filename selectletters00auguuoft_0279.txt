No. 31 (Ep. CXXII)

Redeemer, who cannot 116, foretold would come to
pass. So far then from having any right to curtail
your works of mercy‚ you ought to increase them
bey ond your usual measure. For just as they who
see in 1116 crumbling of its walls 1116 impending
dow nfall of their 1101116, hasten 10 remove 11161113611 63
to places more secure, so ought Christian 1163113, 1116
111016 they feel by the increase of its trials 1116 ap-
proaching downfall of this present world, 10 116 1116
more prompt and active in transferring to the treasury
of heaven those goods they were proposing to store
up on earth; in this way, if any human misfortune
occurs, he who has removed from the place of destruc—
tion may rejoice, but if no such misfortune follows,
he may not grieve, since, destined 301116 day to die,
he has committed 1113 own possessions to 1113 ever-
lasting Lord, to *W hom he will one (131 depart.
Therefore, mv 116101 6(1 11161111611, from 111131 116 1133
let each one of y ou according to his 31111111 —and of
that each man is the best judge—gixe his accus-
tomed share with more than his accustomed cheerful-
ness, and cherish in your 1163113 amid all the vexations
of this present world that admonition of the Apostle‚
in Which he says t “ The Lord is at hand 3 be careful
for nothing.''“ Let me have such reports of you that
I may know that it is 1101 because of my presence
but because of God’s command, Who is never absent

' from you, that you follow the practice you have

followed for many years while I was present with
you, and sometimes even when I was absent. The
Lord preserve you in peace, my beloved brethren.
Pray for us,
