AUGUSTINE TO DARIL'SJ MY DESERVEDLY
ILLLSTRIOL‘S AND MOST DISTINGL‘ISHED
LORD AND SON WARMLY CHERISHED IN
CHRIST

From my holy brethren and fellow-bishops Urbanus 1
and Novatus c I have learned of your character and
high position 3 one of them had the good fortune to
make your acquaintance in the 103311 of Hilari near
Carthage and recently at Sicca, the other at Sitifis.
Through them it has been brought about that I 100

Tunis; its strategical position on the great roads between
Numidia and Proconsular Africa gave it great importance.

Novatus was bishop of Sitifis (Setif) in Mauretaniam 110
was addressed by Augustine in No. 22 above. The Η llarense

manuscripts of this letter reads lurensi, whis is probably the
adjectiva] form of the name Lares, an important town
10 miles south—east of Sicca Veneria and prominent during
the war with Jugurtha (Sallust, luy. 90). Though at a
considerable distance from Carthage, it was within Cartha—
ginian territory, and was easy for Darius to reach from
Sicca, so Ι 3111 inclined to adopt the reading Larensi here in
place of the unidentifiable Hilarensi.
