No. 29 (Ep. cx)

(A.n. 409)

TO MY BLESSED AND DEAREST LORD, MY
VENERABLE AND MUCH DESIRED BROTHER
AND FELLOW-PRIEST‚ SEVERUS‚0 AND
THE BRETHREN WHO ARE WITH YOU, AU-
GUSTINE AND THE BRETHREN WHO ΑΒΕ
WITH ME SEND GREETING IN THE LORD

This letter from me, which has been brought to you
by my very dear son and fellow-deacon‚ Timothy,d
was ready for his departure, when my sons Quod-
vultdeus and Gaudentius ‘³ reached us with a letter
from you. That is the reason why Timothy, who was
departing forthwith‚ did not bring a reply from me,
since after their arrival he waited with us here only
a very short time and was apparently on the point
of departure at any minute. But even ifI had sent
a reply by him, I should still be in your debt, for
even now, though Ι seem to have replied, Ι 3111 in
your debt, Ι do not mean for affection, for the more
we have paid of that, the more we owe (we are always
in debt for it, as the Apostle's words show, ‘⁴ Owe

from the English Puritans‚ of employing these religious
names: Augustine's own son was called Adeodatus‚ and
there are many examples of such names as Deogratias,
Deumhabet, Deusdedst, Habetdeus, Vincemalus, etc.
