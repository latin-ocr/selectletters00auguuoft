TO ΝΥ LORD MOST BLESSED AND REVER-
ENTLY CHERISHED AND SINCERE‚ ME-
MORIUS‚‹² MY BROTHER AND FELLow-
BISHOP MOST LONGED FOR, AL'GL’STINE
SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

I should 1101 now write any letter 10 your holy 1
Charity without sending those books 11131 you de-
manded from me by the 111051 urgent right of holy
affection, that by 11115 361 of obedience at least Ι
might make reply 10 111056 1611615 of yours 111111
which you were good enough 10 burden me rather
111311 10 honour me. Yet where I am bent low by
the burden, even there I am raised up by your love.
For it 15 110 ordinary person that loves me, upraises
me and makes me feel a picked man, but he can do
so, that priest of the Lord, whom I feel to be so
