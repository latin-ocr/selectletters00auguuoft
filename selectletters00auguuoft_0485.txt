No. 51 (Ep. ccxx)

such a calamity! Further, people say that 3⁷ou have
not been content 111111 your o33⁷n 33 ife but have
degraded yourself by having 1111616011156 33ith some
concubines or other. But perhaps this' 15 l3⁷ 1110 goss ip.
These evils, numeious and gra3e and known to 5

everybody, have been perpetiated b3 you since
your marriage, and so what am Ι 10 say ἓ You are
3 Christian, 3ou possess intelligence,a 3⁷ou chel-ish
the fear of God. Conside1 for youiself the things
I am unwilling to utter, and 3 011 11111 find 11011 great
are the evils for which you ought to do penance. I
believe 11 15 for that that the Lord is sparing you and
delivering you from all dangers, 50 that you may do
it 35 11 should 116 done, but on condition that 3⁷ou
hearken to the words, “”Τ3111 1101 10 be con3⁷ cited
to the Lord and put not off fi om da3 to da3⁷’. ’ὂ Y ou
maintain that your cause is just, c but I cannot judge
of that, for I 3111 unable to hear both sides3 but
whatever your cause be, and of that at prtesen

there is no need of inquiiy 01 discussion, can 3⁷ou
deny before God that you would 1101 11316 fallen
into these straits ify ou had not lo3⁷ ed the good things
of this world, 33hich like 3 servant of God, 35 33⁷e
knew you to be formerly, you ought entirely 10 have
despised and counted as nothing ? Accepting what
was bestowed on you, you should have employed it to
advance your godliness 3 that which was denied you
or was entrusted to you to administer, you should
1101 have sought after in such 3 way 35 to reduce
yourself because of it to the present straits, in which,
because of the love felt for vain things, evil things
are done—few, indeed, by you, but many because of

sequent disgrace into which Boniface fell. It was unjust,
for Aetius betrayed both the Empress and his rival.
