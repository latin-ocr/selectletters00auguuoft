TO MY SAINTLY LORD AND DESERVEDLY RE-
VERED BROTHER AND FELLOW-BISHOP,
JOHN‚⁰ AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING IN
THE LORD

I would not for anything venture to cherish re· l
sentment that I have not been honoured with letters
from your Holiness ; for it is better for me to believe
that you, my saintly lord and deservedly revered
brother, were without anyone to convey thern, than
to harbour the suspicion that your Grace was scorning
me. But now, as Ι have learned that Luke,the servant
of God by whom I am sending this letter to you, is
going to return very shortly, Ι 511311 give hearty thanks
to the Lord and to your Benignity, if you have the
kindness to visit me by letter. As for Pelagius, our
brother and your son, to whom I hear you show
much affection, I suggest that the affection you show
him be such that the people who know him and have
carefully listened to him may not imagine that your
Holiness is being deceived by him.

Some of his disciples, indeed, young men of very 2
noble birth and education in the liberal artsss' gave
up their worldly prospects at his persuasion and
betook themselves to the service of God. W'hen,
however, they gave evidence of certain theories at
variance m‘th sound doctrine as contained in the
Gospel of the Saviour and declared in the words of

Augustine replied in his De Natura et Gratia, dedicated to
the two young men ; their letter of thanks on receiving the
reply is printed as Ep. clxviii.
