ΝΟ. 42 (Ep. CLXXXIX)

in peace ς for peace is not sought in order that war
may be aroused, but war is waged in order that
peace may be obtained. So then be a peace-maker
even when warring, that by overcoming those whom
you conquer, you may bring them to the advantages
of peace, for “ blessed are the peace—makers‚” says
the Lord, “ for they shall be called the children of
God.” a Yet if human peace is so sweet for procuring
the temporal salvation of men, how much sweeter is
peace with God for procuring the eternal salvation
of 1116 angels! So let it be your necessity and not your
choice that slays the enemy who is fighting against
you. Just as violence is the portion of him who rebels
and resists, so mercy is the due of him who has been
conquered or captured, especially when a disturbance
of the peace is not to 116 feared.

Let your character be adorned by chastity in the 7
marriage-hond, adorned by sobriety and moderation‚
for it is a very disgraceful thing that lust should over-
601116 0116 whom man finds unconquerable, and that -
wine should overwhelm one whom the sword assails
in vain. If you lack earthly 1161165, 161 them not be
sought in the world by evil works ; but if you possess
them, let them be laid up in 11631611 by good works.
The manly Christian spirit ought neither to be elated
by their accession nor depressed by their departure.
Let us rather keep in mind what the Lord says,
“ Where your treasure 15, there will your 116311 116
3150,” ²² and certainly when we hear the exhortation to
lift up our hearts, we ought unfeignedly to make the
response which you know we do 1113κ6.ο

In such matters as this, however, I know 11131 you 8
316 very zealous, and I take great delight in your
reputation and greatly congratulate you in the Lord
