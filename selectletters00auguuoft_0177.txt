Nc. 16 (Ep. L)—-NO. 17 (Ep. Lx)

glaring criminality and shocking barbarity of your
fiendish conduct, which has made your streets and
shrines run red with blood and resound with cries of
murder. Among you the laws of Rome have been
consigned to oblivion, the fear of righteous judgement
has been trampled under foot, and for the Crown
you have assuredly neither respect nor awe. Among
you the innocent blood of exactly sixty Christian
brethren has been spilt, and he who has the more
murders to his credit has enjoyed various honours
and been appointed to the chief post in your assembly.
See now, let us come to the chief point, If you
mention your Hercules, we shall straightway restore
it to you ; we have quarries at hand, and there is no
lack of stone 3 there are in addition various kinds of
marble and a sufficient supply of craftsmen. More-
over, your god will be chiseled, smoothed off and
ornamented: we shall even add red ochre to paint
the blush with which your holy prayers may be
uttered. For if you say the Hercules is your own,
we shall contribute a penny each and buy a god for
you from your own crastsman. Restore then the
souls that your ferocious hand has destroyed, and as
we give back your Hercules, so do you restore these
many souls.
