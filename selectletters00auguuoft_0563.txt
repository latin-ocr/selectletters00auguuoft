TO THE MOST DEVOUT LADY, MY DAUGHTER
ECDICIA,a AL'GUSTINE SENDS GREETING IN
THE LORD

After reading your Re3·erence’s letter and asking 1
its bearer the questions that remained to be asked,
I have been very greatly grieved that you chose so to
act towards your husband that the edifice of chastity
which had already begun to be built up in him has,
through his failure to persevere, toppled to the pitiful
downfall of adultery. If after making to God 3 3‘ow
of chastity and already undertaking its observance in
deed and in disposition, he had returned to his wife’s
body, his case would have been deplorable enough ;
but how much more deplorable is it now that 110 1135
plunged to deeper destruction, with such precipitate
collapse into adultery, furious 1011 ‘11 ds 3 011,111-
jurious to himself, as if his rage at 3ou 11 ould be
the more 11010111 if he accomplished his own ruini
This great mischief 1135 001110 about because 3ou
failed to treat him 331tn the model ation 3ou ought,
for although by agreement 3 011 33 ere no longer
coming together' in carnal intercourse, 3 et in 311 other
things you ought to have shown the subj ection of a
wife to your husband in compliance with the marriage-
bond, especially as you were both members of the
body of Christss' Indeed, if you, a believer, had had
a husband who was an unbeliever, it would have
been your duty to conduct yourself with submissive-
ness, as the Apostles enjoined, so as to win him to

th} 10211110· 0111 of account the fact that I know you 2
