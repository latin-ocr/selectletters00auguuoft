No. 35 (Ep. CXLIV)

may be, assuredly do not impair the promises of God,
Who said to Abraham, “ In thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed,’' a a promise believed
when it was heard as a prophecy and denied when it is
seen as an accomplished fact), let them for the pre-
sent meditate upon this very brief, but, unless I am
mistaken, very unanswerable argument, that the case
was either tried before a church court across the sea,
or was not tried 3 if it was not tried there, the society
of Christians among all the overseas nations is guilt-
less 3 we rej oice in communion with that society, and
so their separation from those guiltless brethren is
clearly an act of sacrilegious disruption. If, again,
the case was tried there, who can fail to understand,
and feel, and see, that those whose communion is
sundered from those others are the defeated party
in the case? Let them have their choice then,
whether they prefer to accept the verdict of the
ecclesiastical judges or the insinuations of the
defeated plaintiffs. Notice carefully, as you are
wise enough to do, that no serious confutation can
be offered against this tersely expressed, yet easily
understood, dilemma3 and yet Polemo in his dis-
sipation was more easily turned from his drunken-
ness than they from the folly of their deeply
rooted errorss

Grant me pardon‚ my noble and justly honoured
lords, my beloved and much longed for brethren,
for a letter which is perhaps more lengthy than
agreeable, but yet, in my opinion, more likely to
profit you than to flatter you. May God give fulfil-
ment to the desire we both share, that I should visit
you 1 VVords fail me to express the great and fervent
love that inflames me to see you, but I have no doubt
