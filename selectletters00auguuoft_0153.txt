No 11 (Ep. xxxiv)

116 15 exhibited to the eyes of all the disgusted con-
gregation as a regenerate man.

Do you, a man of sober judgement, really approve 3
of this ? Ι should never believe 11 of you3 Iknow
how sensible a man you are. A mother after the
flesh is beaten on the body which bore and nurtured
her thankless 5011; when the Church, his spiritual
mother, forbids this, she too is beaten in her sacra-
ments, by which she bore and nurtured her thank-
less son. Don’t you think it is as if he had said in
his rage for a parent’s blood, “ What shall Ι (10 10 1116
Church, which forbids my beating my mother? I
know what Ι will do. Ι 11111 wound her too with every
possible insult3 Ι will commit anything that will
cause her members pain3 I will betake me to those
who are experienced in sneering at the grace in which
she gave me birth, in destroying the form I received
in her womb ; 111111 611161 agonies let me rack both
these mothers of mine. Let the one who gave me
second birth be the first to give me burial ; for her
grief I shall seek spiritual death, but for the other's
death I shall continue my earthly life.'' What else
can we expect, my esteemed Eusebius, than this,
that the man who, while he was in the Catholic
Church, was restrained from thrashing the un-
fortunate woman, crippled 111111 age and a 101161)γ
widow, 11111 be free to employ his weapons against
her, now that he is a Donatist ? What other purpose
was inhis raving heart when he said to his mother,
“ I will go over to the Donatist party and 11111
drink your blood''? See now, with blood-stained
conscience, but arrayed in white vestments, he has
carried out one part of 1115 1111631 ; 1116 second part,
the drinking of his mot-her’s blood, awaits fulfilment.
