ciently large band of armed men. This was reported
to me ; but since there was as yet no information who
his abductors were nor where they had taken him,
though suspicion fell on the man who had frightened
him into seeking protection from the Church, I at
once communicated with the tribune in command of
the coast-guards. He sent soldiers 3 no one could be
found, but in the morning we discovered the house
in which he had been detained and found that his
keeper had left with him after cock-crow. I also
sent to the place to which it was said he had been
carried off. WVhen the afore-mentioned officer was
found, he refused to grant to the priest I had sent
permission even to see him. Next day I sent a letter
requesting for him the privilege which the Emperor
appointed in such cases as this,⁰ namely, that those
under summons to appear in court should be asked
at the municipal bench if they were willing to spend
thirty days in that town under lenient observation,
to put their affairs in order or to prepare their
finances. My expectation was that during that period
we could perhaps reach a settlement of his case by
friendly discussion. Already, however, he had gone
off with that officer and was taken to prison, but
there is some fear that if he be brought before the
governor's tribunal, he may suffer some hardship,
for although that judge has an excellent reputation
for rectitude, Faventius's opponent in the case is a
very wealthy man. So to prevent the exercise of any
undue influence in that court by his money, I beg
your Holiness, my dearest lord and venerable brother,
to hand my letter to the honourable magistrate, a
man very dear to me, and to read this one to him, for
I do not think it necessary to write a second account
