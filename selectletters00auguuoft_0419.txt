No. 47 (Ep. cclx)

mony, at the last minute a the man who had appeared
to me to be ready left me in the lurch by absolutely
opposing our plans. As the event proved, I ought
certainly to have postponed a matter fraught with
such dangers, instead of hurrying it on3 however,
not wanting the very eminent and holy Senior, after
being at the trouble of coming all the way to uS, to go
back home without accomplishing the purpose for
which he had made such a long journey, I put for-
ward, without waiting to be asked, a certain young
man Antoninus, who was with me at the time. He
had been brought up by me in the monastery from
his earliest yearS, but beyond holding the office of
reader, he had no experience of any of the ranks or
labours of clerical life 3 yet those unfortunate people,
not knowing what lay before them, very dutifully
acquiesced in my offer of him. Why say more ?
The deed was done3 he began his career as their
bisho ,ὓ
Wffat am I to do ? I do not- want to charge before 4

your Reverence one whom I gathered in and fostered,
nor do I want to abandon those for whose in-gathering
I travailed with anxiety and pain ; and how I am to
do both I cannot discover. The matter has indeed
come to such a scandalous pass that those who yielded
to my wish to have him undertake episcopal office, in
the belief that it was to their own best interest, have
approached me here and laid charges against him.
Among these charges the most serious offence of gross
immorality made against him, not by those over whom

consecrate Antoninus, but sought the services of his Primate.
The co-operation of other bishops in episcopal consecration
was expressly enjoined by the Council of Nicaea, which
prescribes thr-ee as a general rule (Canon IV.).
