you must beware of the wrath of God both here and

(A.D. 4052)

TO JEROME, MY LORD DEARLY BELOVED AND
MUCH LONGED FOR, AND MY HONOURED
BROTHER IN CHRIST AND FELLow-PRIEST‚
AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING IN THE
LORD α

Ι have heard that my letter has safely reached you, 1
but I would by no means make it a charge against
your affection that as yet I have not been favoured
with a reply 3 no doubt something has come in your
way. So I recognize that I must rather beseech the
Lord to provide the opportunity of carrying out your
intention to send the answer you have written, since
He has already provided that of writing it, for you can
very easily do so when you feel so disposed.

Further, I have hesitated whether indeed to give 2
credence to a report which has reached me, but it is
my duty not to hesitate about writing something to
you concerning it as well. Briefly, this is the point ε
Ι have been told that certain brethren have hinted
to your Charity that I wrote a book against you and
sent it to Rome. Rest assured that this statement
is untrue t I call our God to witness that this I have
not done. But if some remarks happen to be found
in some of my writings, in which I am found taking a
different view from you on any point, I think you
ought to know, or if you have no means of knowing‚
to believe, that what I have written is not directed
against you, but is an expression of my own opinion.
And indeed, in so saying, I not only profess myself
