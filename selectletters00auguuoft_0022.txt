INTRODUCTION

direction of local pre-occupations and aristocratic
administrationNVith the isolation of each territorial
unit and its economic and administrative sels-suffici-
ency, centralized sovereignty disappeared before a
divided and dissipated control which owed little
allegiance and provided little support to the needs or
to the idea of an empire. Each fundus, Augustine
tells us, is a practica] independent unit3 it has its
own machinery, its own church or churches, and its
own bishop. In these Letters the reader will often
be struck by the existence of such bishops in charge
of what are apparently very small churches and very
limited territories, and in this fact of decentralization
he will find the explanation. The same fact very
largely accounts for the persistence of Donatism and
the violence of its antagonism to the Catholic Church.
The ancient stock, even after nearly six hundred
years of Roman cim'lization, remained largely un-
changed3 the Punic language was spoken even in
Hippo, and in the country districts it was often the
only speech. The enormous extension of landed
properties in Africa laid upon the native population a
heavy burden of serfdom which provoked acute social
and racia] hatred, and when, through the generosity
of the emperors, the Church itself, in addition to
being officially recognized, became a landed pro-
prietor, that opposition which had begun as a simple
question of ecclesiastica] rivalry was soon augmented
by the accession of discontented slaves who were
prompted to rebellion by economic oppression and
social grievances. Their armed bands of circum-
celliones wandered round the country, attacking and
burning property and wreaking the mostÎ‡ violent
vengeance upon landowners and Catholic priests,
