No. 50 (Ep. ccxm

against the new heretics, the Pelagians‚ who declare
that the grace of God is bestowed according to our
merits ; 50 that he who glories has to glory, not in
the Lord, but in himself, that is, in man, not in the
Lord. Νο111 11115 15 forbidden by the apostle, in the
11· 01(15, “Let no man glory in man, ’' and in another
place 116 says, “He that glorieth 161 him glory in the
Lord.'' α But these 116161165, imagining that 11161
become righteous of themselves, 35 if it 33⁷ as they
11161115611 65 and not God 33⁷ho granted this to them,
601151516111111 enough glory in 11161115611 65 311(1 1101 111
1116 Lord. To such 1116 apostle say 5, “W ho maketh
thee 10 differ from another?’' ,b 5311110· this 011 1116
ground that what makes 3 111311 10 differ from that mass
of perdition which had 115 origin in Adam and makes
him 3 1165561 unto honour and not unto dishonour, ⁰ is
God alone. But since 6311131111311,511·011611 33 ith empt3
pride, might, on hearing the question‘ 3‘3' ho maketh
thee 10 differ from another. Ρ’ ‚make ans33 61 either in
thought or in 33 ord and say, ‘It‘ 15 m3⁷ saith 11131 makes
me 10 differ3 11111 pray ers that make me to differ· ‚
my righteousness that makes me to differ, '’ the
apostle at once met these thoughts half- 3-3⁷a3⁷ and
said, ‘For what hast thou 11131 111011 didst not
recei3·.e Ρ Now, if thou didst receive it, 111111 (1051
thou glory, 35 if thou didst not receive it?' 'd For
they glory just as if they did not receive it, those
who imagine they are justified of themselves ; they
glory therefore in themselves and not in the Lord.
That is the reason why, in that letter that has come 4
into 110111·11311(15,Ι,1116 author of it‚⁶ ha3 e proved fr om
