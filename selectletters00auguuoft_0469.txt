his (166(15.α But y et they have pointed out too that
there are many of 3ou who do not. share these
opinions, but confess that our free· will is aided by
the grace of God so that we may think and do what
is right, and that, when the Lord 6011165 10 render to
every man according to his deeds, he will find our
deeds good—deeds “ which God hath before ordained
that we should walk in them. '' b Those who hold these
01)11110115, hold right opinions.

‘I beseech y‚ou therefor,e “brethren, '' as the2

Lord J esus Christ, that 3 6 311 speak the 531116 1111118
