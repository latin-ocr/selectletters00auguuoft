stand now, ye simple among the people3 and ye
fools‚ at length be 11150 ’a From 1110 170137 fact, 111011,
that we have been commanded and insti 1101οἀ 10
understand and be 11150, it follows that our obedience
is demanded, and it cannot exist unless through free-
Will. Yet if it were in our power of our own free-will
to obey this precept to understand and be wisc,
without the assistance of grace, it would be useless
to say to God‚ “ Give me understanding, that I may
learn Thy commandments,” ὂ 1101 would it be written
in the Gospel, “ Then opened He their understandfflg,
that they might understand the Scriptures '² ⁰ ; nor
would the apostle James say, “ If any of you lack
wisdom‚ let him ask of God, Who giveth to all men
liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given
him.' ’d But the Lord is able to grant both to 3 011 and
10 us, to rejoice i the spe ι13 tidings of 30111· peace
and holy concord? I gi eet 011, 1101 onl3 in m3 own
