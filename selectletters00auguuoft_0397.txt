TO SIXTUS‚‘² MY VENERABLE LORD AND HOLY
BROTHER AND FELLow-PRIEST, WORTHY
TO BE CHERISHED IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST,
AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

Since the letter your Grace sent by the hands of 1
our holy brother, the priest Firmus, reached Hippo
during my absence, and on my return I had the
chance to read it only after the bearer of it had taken
his departure, this first opportunity of replying (and
it is a very welcome one too) is afforded by our well-
beloved son, the acolyte Albinus.⁶ Your letter, ad-
dressed to Alypius and myself together, came at a time
when we were not together, so in consequence you
receive a letter from each of us, not one in the com-
mon name of us both, for the bearer of this letter, hav-
ing left me, will on his way pass by my revered brother
and fellow-bishop, Alypius, so that he may write one
for himself in reply to your Holiness 3 that letter of
yours, after reading it, I sent on to him by the same
bearer. As for the great joy with which your letter
filled me, why should one attempt to utter feelings
that defy utterance? Indeed, I am not sure that

¹² Albinus is mentioned as bearer of Epp. cxcii„ cxciii.
and cxciv. to Rome. The acolytes formed one of the minor
orders in the Church, introduced about the beginning of the
third century. T hough the name is Greek (ἀκόλουθοι), the
office was peculiar to the Western Church; in the rituals of
the Greek Church, the word is only a synonym for sub-deacon.
As the name implies‚ the acolytes were the immediate
attendants and followers of the bishops3 their specific duties

were to light the candles of the church and to attend the
officiating priest with wine for the Eucharist.
