No 29 (Ep. CX)

anxieties that constitute the inevitab'le bondage of a
servant of the Lord. IfI squander those on other
business, I seem to myself to be neglecting my
duties.

Yet, when you want me to write you a lengthy 6
letter, Ι do indeed owe you that, I must confess3 Ι
surely do owe that to your sweet, sincere, and single-
minded desire. But since you are a good lover of
justice, Ι warn you to hear with the greater favour
what I say about this object of your affection. You see
that what I owe to you and others as well has a prior
claim over what Ι owe to you alone ; and time fails
me for everytffing, when it fails me even for my first
duties. So all those who are nearest and dearest to
me (and in Christ's name you are among the first of
these) will only be doing their duty if they not only
lay no further burden of writing on me themselves,
but with all the authority and holy kindness they
can, forbid others also to do so, so that I may not
seem hard-hearted when Ι fail to give what each one
has asked, my own desire being all the time to pay
the debt I owe to all. Finally, when your Reverence
visits me, as Ι hope you will, for I have your promise,
you will understand with what litei-ary tasks so much
of my time is taken up, and you will be more insistent
in doing what Ι have asked, deterring any others
you can from their desire to impose any more writing
on me. May the Lord our God fill your spacious
and holy breast and heart which He Himself has
made, my most saintly lord!
