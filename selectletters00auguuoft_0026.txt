INTRODUCTION

bishops held that baptism could not be validly
administered by heretics, since they could not give

what they did not possess. The Donatists, in turn, ’

made the validity of a Sacrament depend upon the

apostolicity of its episcopate. Further, in his polemio
against Donatism, he was led to forgo his earlier opinion
in favour of freedom of thought, and to enunciate the
theory of religious intolerance. To this momentous
step his progress was gradual, and he was never,
