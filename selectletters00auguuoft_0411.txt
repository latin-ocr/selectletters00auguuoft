information could I have to be in a position to praise
and love that too in you, save from someone in-
timately familiar with you, who knew your life not on
the surface‚ but within ? So, since you are thus, by
God’s blessing, good possessing,a1 too take pleasure in
talking with you more intimately and at rather greater
length. I know I shall not weary you if I send you
something comprehensive, the reading of which will
keep you all the longer in my company. For I have
learned too that among your many arduous duties you
are ready and glad to read my little books, and take
considerable delight in them, when they happen to
come into your hands, even if they are addressed to
others ; how much greater should be your pleasure in
receiving one addressed to yourself‚ in which I speak
to you as though you were present, and how much
more thorough the attention you kindly bestow upon
it 1 From this letter, then, pass on to the book that
accompanies it ; why it was written and why it was
especially sent to you, your Reverence will more con-
veniently find out from the opening chapter.
