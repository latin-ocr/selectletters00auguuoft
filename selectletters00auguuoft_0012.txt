PREFACE

and variety of the manuscripts, which would have
rendered necessary a fresh and lengthy series of
sigla for each letter, has made it practically im-
possible to provide critical notes for all the changes
introduced into the text, and many of these have
been adopted without remark. Goldbacher's re-
viewers repeatedly pointed out the difficulties made
for the reader by his method of quoting his manu-
script authorities, but in an edition of this size no
improvement has been attempted, and, as his appara-
tus criticus has supplied the material for improving
his text, to it the textual critic is referred.

I have had before me the translations by Poujoulat,
Cunningham and Miss Allies. Of these Poujoulat is
fluent, but given to avoiding difficulties3 Cunning-
ham is, on the whole, accurate, but his dull and
over-litera] style makes his translation heavy reading,
though here and there he finds a phrase which it
would have been hard to better, in difficulties I
have occasionally adopted or adapted his rendering.
Miss Allies gives a paraphrase which is not of much
help alongside the Latin.

To Mr. C. J. Fordyce, of J esus College, Oxford,
I am indebted for a careful reading of the greater
part of my translation and his high scholarship and
accuracy have removed many weaknesses and rough-
nesscs. Messrs. R. and R. Clarkâ€™s readers and printers
have been models of exactness and speed. Finally,
I owe a great debt, which I can merely acknow-
ledge, to three men who in this particular field
have given me guidance and inspiration: the late
John Swinnerton Phillimore, of Glasgow University,
to whose scholarship, kindliness and influence no
words could be adequate tribute3 the late Alois
