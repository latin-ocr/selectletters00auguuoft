No. 61 (Ep. CCLXVIII)

you, holy brethren, about his needs, but, deterred by
shame, he implored me not to do it. So Ι myself,
under pressure of greater needs, accepted seventeen
solidi from our brother lNIacedoniusfl and these I
immediately handed over on his behoof, while he
promised that on a certain day he could meet the
repayment, and agreed that if he was not able to
meet it, an appeal should be made for him to that
compassion of yours, which it is your habit to dis-
play as 3 brotherly feeling for our brethren.
Wherefore, now that he 15 absent, it remains for
you to give your backing, not to him, for 110 0116
can apply compulsion to him in his absence, but
to my promise, for with you my good name and
fame are always present. For already the day on
which he promised he would meet the debt, is past
and gone, and I find no reply to make to him who
gave me the amount on trust, save to do what I
promised I would do. But since I had no informa-
tion about this matter on the day of Pentecost, so
that I might have made 311 appeal when the crowd
at Church was greater 111311 1151131, Ι ask you to be
good enough to take this letter as my voice, while in
your hearts Our Lord and God speaks warning and
exhortation ; in Him you have put your trust, and
He never leaves us so long as we fear and honour His
name ; in Him I too am united with you, although
in body I seem to have departed from you3 from
Him comes the promise of the harvest of eternal life
from this seed of good works, for the apostle says ε
“ And let us not be weary in well—doing, for in due
season we shall reap if we faint not. As we there-
fore have opportunity, let us do good unto all men,
especially unto them who are 01 the household 01
