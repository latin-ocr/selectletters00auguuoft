being reluctant to agree to it that he actually ex-
pressed his delight, but he regretted that they had
no written instructions on the matter, as their
friendly relations not unreasonably entitled him to

forward‚ though she has not come forward as yet, and
her wishes about the handjng over of her daughter
naturally have, in my opinion, precedence over all
others, unless the girl is by that time of an age to
have a more legitimate claim to choose for herself
what she wants. Take this point too into considera-
tion, my true friend, that if supreme and undivided
power over her marriage were entrusted to me and
she herself, if of age and desirous of marrying, left
me free, with God as my Judge, to give her hand to
the one I desired‚ then I declare, and decla-re with
sincerity, my satisfaction with the condition you
suggest, provided that, because of God my J udge,
I should not be repudiating a better one; but
whether a better one will turn up, is naturally un-
certain. So your Charity will see how many con-
siderations conspire to make it quite impossible for
me at present to promise her to anyone.
