ΝΟ. 33 (Ep. cxxvi)

my official communication. Anyone, therefore, who
happens to give you an account which contradicts the
one Ι have given you is either lying or misinformed.
Ι am conscious of having passed over certain points
Which seemed to me irrelevant to my purpose, but
not of having made any false statement. Likewise‚
it is true that our holy son, Pinianus, took the oath in
my presence and with my permission, but it is not
true that he took it at my instigation. He knows this
himself3 the servants of God whom he sent to me
know it, first the saintly Barnabas, then Timasius, by
whom too he sent me the message about his promise
to take up residence in Hippo. The people, too,
were urging him by their eries to accept office as priest,
not to take an oath 3 but when it was offered,they did
not refuse it, in the hope that, if he came to live
among us, he might become willing to agree to
ordination, and that he would not take his departure,
as he had sworn to do, if he were ordained against his
will. And so even they were actuated in their out-
cries by concern for God's work—for the consecration
to priesthood is surely God's work—and afterwards
feeling dissatisfied with his promise of residence here
without the further stipulation that if he eventually
decided to agree to undertake clerical office he would
do so only in the church of Hippo, it is quite evident
that they were hopeful too of his taking up house
among them, and so, here too, they did not depart
from their zeal for God's work.

How then can you maintain that in so doing they 7
were impelled by a base love of money? In the first
place, the people who raised the outcry have simply
nothing to do with that3 sor just as the people of
Tagaste derive from your gifts to the church of
