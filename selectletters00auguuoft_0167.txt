journey we made together.

Give my greetings to brother Severus b and his 3
company. I should perhaps be writing to them too,
if the bearer's haste allowed it. Ι want, however,
to express my thanks through your Holiness to our
brother Victor for letting me know when he was
going to Constantine. ⁶ Please help me by asking
him if he would mind making his return jour ne3 by
Calama, as he promised me he would, because of that
business he knows of, it is w eighing ver3 heaw'ly on
me, for the elder Nectariusd is very insistent about

it. Good-bye.

SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

in 394 at Nola 1n Campania, where he lived a monastic life,

built a church 1n honour of his patron saint, Felix, and spent
his life and substance in good works‚ dying in 431. His
extant works consist of 51 letters and 36 poems, marked by
grace and fluency and revealing a pious and humble mind,

already medieval in its outlook.
