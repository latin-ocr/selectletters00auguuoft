No. 56 (Ep. CCXLV)

TO MY WELL—BELOVED LORD AND VENERABLE
BROTHER AND FELLOW·PR1EST‚ POSSIDIUS‚⁰
AND THE BRETHREN WHO ΑΗΕ WITH YOU,
AUGUSTINE AND THE BRETHREN WHO ΑΒΕ
WITH ΜΕ SEND GREETING IN THE LORD

What you are to do with those who refuse to 1
oomply requires more consideration than how you
can show them that what they are doing is unlawful.
But at present the letter of your Holiness has found
me extremely busy and at the same time the bearer's
great haste to return has not allowed me either to
make no reply to you or to give an adequate answer
to the problems on which y ou asked my adv loe.
Still, I should not like you to make any over· hasty
decision about the forbidding of ornaments of gold
or finery, except that those who are neither married
nor desirous of being married ought to be thinking
how they may please God. For that class of people
think of worldly things, how they may, if they are
husbands, please their wives, or if wives, please their
husbands θ ; the one exception is that it is not becoming
in women, even in those who are married, to uncover
their hair, since the apostle bids them cover the
whole head.c But as for painting the face d so that it
may appear ruddier or fairer, this is immoral deceit.

. . ora depingas.'’ In Doet. Chr. iv. 21. 49 Angustiae
quotes passages from Cyprian and Ambrose on women who
paint the face, and in De Bono Viduitatis, 19. 924, he advises
a virgin and 3 widow ‘⁶ simulatum eandorem 36 ruborem et
pigmentis illitum non adhiberetis, etiamsi viros habereti53
3οὲ putantes dignos quos falleretis, nec vos quae fallere

e eretis.''
