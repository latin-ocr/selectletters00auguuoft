No. 10 (Ep. XXIX)

the day ? Those who allowed it in times past were
surely not unchristian.'' On hearing this, I was
quite at a loss what weapons to prepare that would
have a greater effect on them, but still, if they
decided to continue in that frame of mind, I was
intending to read that passage from the prophet
Ezekiel, “ The watchman is absolved if he has
uttered a warning of the danger, even if those whom
he has warned have not cared to take precaution,''a
and to shake my garments and depart. But at that
point the Lord showed that He does not forsake us,
and taught me the means He takes to encourage
us to put our trust in Him, for before the time at
which I had to mount into the chon-,b those same
individuals came in to me who, as I had learned, had
complained of my attack upon their long-established
custom. I received them graciously, and needed only
a few words to bring them round to a sound state of
mind. And when it came to the time for my dis-
course, I left out the reading Ι had prepared, since
it no longer appeared to be needed, and made a few
remarks about the very point they had raised, stating
that we could put forward against those who say
“ Why thus late in the day ? '⁵ no briefer and truer
reply than to imitate them and say, “ Yes, thus late
in the day.''

Yet to avoid the appearance of casting any slight 9
upon those who in earlier times either allowed, or
did not venture to forbid, the ignorant mob to
perpetrate these open sins, I explained to them the
critical circumstances in which those practices
apparently arose in the Church. When peace was

while the people stood. It was more commonly called the
βῆμα, bema, or suyqestum.
