ΤΟ BENENATUS‚a MY SAINTLY AND REVERED
LORD AND LONGED FOR BROTHER AND
FELLOWPRIEST, AND THE BRETHREN WHO
ΑΒΕ WITH ΥΟΕ, AL'GL'STINE AND THE
BRETHREN WHO ΑΗΕ WITH ME SEND GREET-
ING IN THE LORD

The girl about whom your Holiness wrote to me is
so minded, that if she were once of full age, she would
not be joined in marriage to anyone ; but her present
age is such that, even if she had a mind to marry, she
ought not at this stage to be gix en or betrothed to
any man. In addition to 11115ῗ my lord Benenatus,
brother revered and w 011-110101 ed the p tection God
is giving her in the church is a protffiion against
wicked men, not an opportunity to give her over to
anyone I choose, but an opportunity to defend her
from seizure by any unsuitable person. The con
dition, therefore, that y ou are good enough to suggest
seems to me satisfactory if she gets married03 at.
’ present, however, while I have greater hopesshe
will carry out the intention she now expresses, I do
not know if she will get married, because at her age
the declaration that she wants to be a nun is rather
the whim of an irresponsible babbler than the vow of
one solemnly pledging herself. Further, she has an
aunt married to our esteemed brother Felix3 when
I consulted him about this (for I could not do other-

w as regarded 35 fitting that the duties of guardianship should
be undertaken by the clergy. Augustine refers to this in
serm. 17 6 2. ‘Pro magno commendantur episcopis patri-
monia pupillorum . . .Pupillum tuetur episcopus, ne
mortuis parentibus ab extraneis opprimatur.'’
