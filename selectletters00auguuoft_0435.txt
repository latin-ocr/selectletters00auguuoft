No. 48 (Ep. ccx)

case he go down to death in false security ? It is a
usual experience and a common occurrence for one
who is reproved to be mortified at the time a and to
wrangle and be recalcitrant, yet afterwards to reflect
within himself b in silence, alone with God, where he is
not afraid of displeasing men by being reproved, but
is afraid to displease God by refusing correction, and
thenceforward to refrain from doing the thing for
which he was justly rebuked, and in proportion as he
hates his sin, to love the brother whom he realizes to
have been the enemy of his sin. But if he belongs
to the number of those of whom it is written, “Rebuke
a fool and he will go on to hate thee,'' 0 the conten—
tion is not born of his love, but yet it tries and tests the
love of his reprover, since he does not repay hatred
with hatred, but the love which prompted his rebuke
endures undisturbed, even when he who was rebuked
requites it with hatred. If the reprover, however,
choose to render evil for evil to the man who takes
offence at being reproved, he was not fit to reprove
another, but clearly fit to be reproved himself. Act
upon these principles, so that occasions of pl ox ocation
may either not arise among y,ou or, when they do
occur, be immediately quenched in speedy peace
Strive more earnestly to disseminate ha1mony among
yourselves than to encourage fault- -finding, for just
as vinegar corlodes a vessel if it remain too long in
it, so anger coi-rodes the heart if it linger on to
another dayfl “These things, therefore, do, and the
God of peace shall be with you.” ‘³ At the same time
pray for us, that we may with cheerful mind carry
out the good advice we ‚have given you.
