nunciation of any association m’th paganism from the
Popes consulted by the Franciscan missionaries to
China in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
Yet if these pagan characteristics were conspicuous
in the African conver-ts, it could hardly have been
otherwise. By the aid of the imperial laws the Church
had eventually succeeded in effacing paganism as an
official cult3 through the Councils it preserved its
doctrine free from subtle semi-paganized interpreta-
tion and misconstruction, and in such writings as
Augustine’s City of God it created a historical back-
ground against which its development could be seen
as a vast providentia] purpose and its organization as
a reflection and anticipation of the Eternal Kingdom
of God. But in the lower levels of everyday practice
among its ordinary believers Christianity wasvforced
to accept and to sanction much that was undoubtedly
of pagan origin and with which, strictly speaking, it
had nothing whatever to do. In the pagan festivals
are to be found the beginnings of the Christian year ;
the worship of Tanit or Astarte or Caelestis may have
encouraged the veneration of the Virgin Mother 3 the
lesser deities of popular superstition were certainly
the prototypes of the Christian saints or demons ; the
belief in magic and divination, probably the most
energetic pagan sentiment of the time, continued
both in and below Christianity and would not be cast
out. It is possible to condemn the compromising
spirit and to see in that century of Christian inter-
penetration with alien and indefensible customs the
ironica] vengeance of the paganism which, publicly
ejected and condemned, returned to cloak itself under
various licit and respectable guises, but it is perhaps
kinder to find in that slow achievement the evidence
