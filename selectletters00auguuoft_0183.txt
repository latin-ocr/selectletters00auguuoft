No. 18 (Ep. LXV)

for religious purposes, and could give no satisfactory
account of it. The next charge proved against him
and admitted by himself was that, on the fast-day of

Sunday, which will fall on the 6th April. This fact I
have been careful to mention to your Reverence
because of the CounciL and I have not concealed it
from him either, but have revealed to him exactly what
