No. 47 (Ep. cclx)

heard indeed in the very words of Antoninus: “Either
I ought to sit in the see to which I was ordained, or
else I ought not to be a bishop at all.'' But who
would find fault with those sentences, except one who
does not reflect that, on the one hand, all these
offences must not be left unpunished, and on the other,
that they are not all to be punished in the same way ?
In his letter about Antoninus, addressed to his 9
bishop, the saintly Pope Boniface, with the vigilance
and caution of a true pastor, put the words, “ Provided
that he has faithfully revealed the sequence of events
to us.’' So now accept this statement of the sequence
of events which he in his memorandum passed
over in silence, and further, of what happened after
the letter of that man of blessed memory was read
in Africa ς do you come to the aid of men who implore
your aid in Christ’s mercy more earnestly than did he,
from whose harassment they seek deliverance. For
threats are being made to the people, either by
Antoninus himself or by oft-repeatedrumours,‘¹ of legal
processes and public officials and military attacks that
are ῖο enforce the decision of the Apostolic See 3 in con-
sequence, those unfortunate people, though Catholic
Christians, are in dread of heavier punishment from
a Catholic bishop than what they feared from the
laws of Catholic emperors when they were hereticS.
Do not let that be so, Ι implore you by the blood of
Christ, by the memory of the apostle Peter who
warned those placed in authority over Christian
peoples not to lord it over their brethren.b For
myself, I commend to the gracious love of your
Holiness both the Catholics of Fussala, my children

etiarn clericos vestros quibuscumque petentibus nolite mittere,
nolite concedere.'’ ¹> 1 Pet. v, 3.
