No. 27 (Ep. c)

praiseworthy son, that no small consolation has been
sent us from heaven, when a man of your character
and great devotion to the name of Christ has been
raised to the dignity of proconsul, so that your
power seconded by your goodwill may restrain

with which you discover it has been assailed or dis-
tressed, to forget that you possess the power of life
and death, but not to forget my entreaty. And do
