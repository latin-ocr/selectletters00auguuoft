No. 29 (Ep. CX)

burdening myself with a debt even greater? Still, it
is easy to show (and if I do not show, it is easy for you
to see) that the truth can be uttered with insincerity‚
and untruth with sincerity ; for a man who believes
what he says speaks with sincerity, even if what he
says be untrue, while a man who does not believe what
he says speaks with insincerity, even if what he says
be true. Have Ι any doubt that you do believe what
you wrote about me Ρ Yet, when I fail to recognize
in myself the things you praise, it is possible that in
all sincerity you were saying about me what was not
true.

But I do not want you to be so misled even in 4
your kindness of heart 3 to that kindness I am
already in debt, since I could say with no less sincerity
and no less kindness things that are true about yon,
if Ι were not anxious, as Ι said already, to spare
your modesty. As for me, when praise is given me
by one who is very near and very dear to my soul,
I feel as if Ι were being praised by myself. So
you see how embarrassing a position it is, even if
what is said is true ; how much more embarrassing
since you, being my other soul—nay, we are but one
soul, you and I—-are just as misled in thinking I
possess qualities that I do not possess, as a single
individual can be misled about himself. And I do
not want that to happen, not simply to keep you, so
dear a friend of mine, from being misled, but also
to keep you from slackening in your prayers that
I may become what you believe I am already. I
am not in your debt in such a way that with the
same kindness and anticipation I should believe and
speak favourably about qualities which you yourself
are aware of not as yet possessing, but I am in debt
