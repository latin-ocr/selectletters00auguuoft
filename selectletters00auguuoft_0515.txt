No. 54 (Ep. ccxxxi)

qualities that are w or thy of being praised 316 thought
not worth possessing unless a man is praised by &his
fellows, or, on the other hand, 1111611 3 111311 desires
great praise for things which are worthiei of either
slight praise or even censure. Hence Horace was
much more cautious than Ennius in saying a :

Swell you with lust for praise Ρ Τ11611 read thrice o'er

passage, Please all men in 311 things, “ 61611 33 Ι

reason,‘ ‘Not secking mine own profit, but the profit
