[TO THE SENIOR ALYPIL'S FROM AUGL'STINE,
ABOUT THE CONVERSION OF DIOSCL'RL'S α]

Brother Paul has arrived back safely ; he reports
that his affairs have been considered favourably ; the
Lord will grant that this may be the last of them.
He sends you hearty greetings and gives us the
joyful news about Gavinianus, that having secui-ed
deliverance, by God's mercy, from that case of his,
he is now not only a Christian but has become a very
admirable member of the Clmrch‚b having received
baptism last Easter, and professing in his heart and
with his mouth ⁰ the grace that was bestowed on him.
I could never express the greatness of my longing for
him, but you know how dear he is to me. The town
physician,d Dioscurus, has also become a Christian
and joined the Church‚ having received grace at the
same time. Ι must tell you how it came about, for one
so stiff-'necked and sharp-tongued could have been
subjugated only by a miracle.

His daughter, an only child, the pride of his life,
was ill, and she reached a point when the recovery
of her bodily health was quite despair-ed of, and her
own father gave her up. The story goes (and its truth

. . . a praestationibus quoque publicis liberi immunesque
permaneant ”). Rome and Constantinople had these muni-
cipal doctors appointed in 368, and at Rome there were
fourteen in all, one for each region. In Ep. xli. 2
Augustine speaks of one Hilarinus‚ whom he calls H ippo-
niensem archiatrum et principalem, and another is mentioned

by one of his correspondents in Ep. ccxxx 6.
