No. 39 (Ep. CLXXIII)

deereea that “the shores were fullos dead men ”), and
so gave a complete denial to that argument which you
are wont to deduce from a wrong interpretation of
the words, “ He that washeth himself after touching
a dead body, what availeth his washing ? ⁷⁷ b If then
your bishops had not said, ‘⁶ One case does not com-
promise another case, nor one person another person‚’'
they would have been held to share the guilt in the
case of Primianus ; but in making that assertion they
secured the Catholic Church‚ as we contended, from
any guilt in the case of Caecilian.

But read all the rest and examine it well. Notice 9
whether they have succeeded in proving any evil
against Caecilian himself, from whose person they
attempted to compromise the Church3 notice whether
they have not rather achieved much in his favour and
altogether confirmed the soundness of his case by
the comparatively large number of extr-acts they pro-
duced and recited to the detriment of their own
position. Read those, or have them read to you3
consider the whole matter, give it a further careful
investigation, and choose which you will follow,
whethei you will share our joy in the peace of Christ,
in the unity of the Church Catholic‚ in brotherly
affection, or, in the cause of wicked discord‚ the
Donatist party and saciilegious schism, will endure
still further the importunity of our love for you,

I hear that you often quote and draw attention to 10
the fact recorded in the Gospels that seventy djs-
ciples withdrew from the Lord and were left to their

mortuum, quid ei prodest lavacrum eius ? ” with the omission
of the middle clause, ‘⁶ if he touch it again‚” and a monstrous
perversion of the meaning. The Cathohcs, the Donatists
argued, being morcui, could not confer a valid sacrament.
