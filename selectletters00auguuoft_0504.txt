ST. AUGUSTINE

in saecula ? Amen.

best remembered as the central figure in that Council of 418
which decreed that no African cleric should prosecute 'an
appeal overseas (cf. p. 364 above)—a decree of great im-
portance in the controversy about the supremacy of the see
of Rome. Sicca (or Sicca Veneria, so-called from its famous
temple to Astarte, whom the Romans identified with Venus)
