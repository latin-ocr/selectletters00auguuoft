No. 9 (Ep. xxviii)

Scriptures should have lied—nay, they are not really
different questions, there is no question about it.
Admit even a single well—meant falsehood α into such
an exalted authority, and there will not be left a
single section of those books which, if appearing to
anyone to present difficulties from the point of
view of practice or to be hard to believe from the
point of view of‘ doctrine, will escape, by the same

God, aiming at inflaming love for Him in men compara-

the holy books would the authority of unadulterated
truth stand unchallenged. Do we not observe the
great care with which the same apostle commends
truth in the words: “ And if Christ be not risen,
