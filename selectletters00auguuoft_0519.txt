ΝΟ. 51 (Ep. ccxxxi)

See how much I have said, and Ι hav e not yet 5
said what it is in your 161161· that delighted me far
more than your eloquence‚ far more than y·ou1 pi ’3136
of myself. W hat else do y ou think it 13,110110111 ed Sir,
than this, that I 11317 6 gained the friendship of a man
of your character, even without seeing you—if I ought
to use the words “ without seeing you,'' when I have
seen your mind, if not your body, in your letter 3 in it
I gained an impression of you not, as before, from the
testimony of my brethren, but for mvself. Aheady,
indeed, I had been told what 111311· 161· of man 1 011 were,
but I had not experienced 111131 kind of man 1· 011 11 616
1011 ards me. But I am su re that. from this friendship
of yours even 11117 pl aises (11111611 delight me in 3 w 317 I
have already sufficiently spoken of) will redound all
1116 more richly 10 1116 profit of the Church, since you
possess and study and admire and commend even my
labours in defenee of the Gospel against the remnant of
ungodly demon-worshippers to such 311 extent that, in
proportion 10 your high station, I gain all the greater
reputation 3 illustrious yourself, you add lustre to
their lowliness, and celebrated yourself, you celebrate
them, and wherever you see that they can do good,
you will certainly not allow them to remain unknown.
If you ask me how Ι know that, it is as such that you
have shown yourself to me in your letter. See now
from 11113 how great delight your letter was able to
give me, if, with your good opinion of me, you think
how delighted Ι 3111 by gains for Christ. And when
you inform me that you yourself, who have had the
good fortune, as you say in your letter, to acquire
Christian rights from your parents, your grand-
parents, and even your remotest ancestry, were yet
helped by my efforts in the contest with pagan rites
