No 56 (Ep. ccxm

I am quite sure that even their own husbands do
not want to be so taken in, and they are the only
people for whom women should be allowed to adorn
themselves, and that as a concession‚ not as a com-
mand. For not only is lying paint no real adorn-
ment of Christian men and women, nor yet is the
ostentation of gold and finery ; 1)111 3 good character is.

It is an accursed superstition to wear amulets,a
among which must be reckoned also the earringsb
that men wear on the top part of the ear on one side ;
they are employed not to please 111611, but to do
homage to devils. Who could expect to find in
the Scriptures individual prohibitions of every kind
of ungodly superstition, when 1116 apostle says in
general ternis, ‘⁶ I would not that ye should have
fellowship with (161·115,”Ο and again, “For what
concord hath Christ 111111 Belial ? '',‘² unless in naming
Belial and forbidding in general terms fellowship
with devils, he perchance allowed Christians to
sacrifice to Neptune, because we do not read that
any prohibition was made of Neptune specifically.‘³

b The habit of wearing earrings 15 denounced by Cyprian,
De Hab. γίνῃ. 14 “an vulnera inferre auribus Deus voluit,
quibus innocens adhuc infantia 61 111311 saecularis ignara.
crucietur, ut postea de aurium cicatricibus 61 cavernis pretiosa
grana dependeant, gravia etsi non suo pondere, mercium
tamen quantitate?” and Jerome, Ep. 127. 3 “illae solent
purpurisso et cerussa ora depingere . . . 61 auribus per-
foratis Rubri Maris pretiosissima grana suspendere.” These
passages refer to the wearing of earrings by womenz there
is scanty evidence for their use by men.

⁶ 1 Cor. x. 20. ‘² 2 Cor. vi. 15.

⁶ The cult of Neptune is mentioned several times by
Augustine and seems to have been fairly common in North
Africa (C. Cresc. iii. 78. 893 Doctr. Chr. iii. 7. 11 ς In Ps.
183; Serm. 2, 5 ς In Ps. 145, 6. 12, etc.).
