No, 17 (Ep. Lx)

received no letter from your Holiness, but now I have
read a letter of your Grace about Donatus and his
brother. For a considerable time I could not settle
what answer to make, but after repeated con-
sideration of what would further the welfare of those
whose nurture in Christ is the aim of our service, I
could reach no other conclusion than this 2 we must
not put God's servants in the way of thinking that
the worse their behaviour, the easier their advance-
ment to better postS. For it would only make back-
sliding easier for them and lay a quite undeserved
slight on the regular clergy, if we selected for
clerical service monks who had run away from their
monastery, seeing that our usual practice is to select
for adoption to the ranks of the clergy only those of
higher merit and character from among the monks
who stay on in their monastery. The common
people say that a bad accompanist makes a good
singer; do we want these same common people to
laugh at us in the same way and say that a bad monk
makes a good clergyman? It is a great pity if we
encourage monks to such demoralizing pride and
think fit to lay so serious a slight on the clei-gy, to
whose ranks we ourselves belong. Sometimes even
a good monk hardly makes a good clergyman, if he
possesses sufficient sels-control and yet has not the
necessary education or the finish of a man who has
gone through the normal training.
In the case we are discussing, your Holiness may,
I think, have assumed that it was with my consent
that they abandoned monastic life for a more desir-
able sphere of service among the men of their own
district. That, however, is not so ; they left of
their own accord, of their orm accord they desei-ted
