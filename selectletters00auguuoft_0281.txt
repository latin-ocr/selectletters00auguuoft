TO ALBINA‚ PINIANUS, AND MELANIAJ
HONOURED IN THE LORD, CHERISHED IN
HOLINESS AND LONGED FOR IN BROTHERLY

AFFECTION, AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING
IN THE LORD

Although from the state of my health, or from my l
natural constitution, I cannot endure cold, still I have
never had a chance of suffering greater severishness
than I have done this dreadful winter because of my
inability——I shall not say to go, but to fly, to you (for
to see you I would have fiown across the seas) now
that you are settled so near, after coming so far to visit
us. And perhaps you will think, my godly friends, that
this same severity of the winter was the only cause
of my affliction3 far be it from me, beloved! For
what difficulty or trouble or even danger lies in
those storms that I would not have undergone
and endured in order to be with you, our great
comfort in our great troubles, who in this crooked
and perverse generation are lights kindled into such
brightness by the Light supreme, and are the loftier
for the humility you have taken upon you and the
more illustrious sor the lustre you have scorned? At
the same time I should have too such great spiritual
enjoyment in my earthly birthplace, since it has had

the younger Melania acquired an estate of greater extent
than the town itself. On it were many workers, a balneum,
and two bishops‚ one Donatist and the other Catholic.

This estate she presented to the church of Tagaste (Anal.
Bolland. viii„ 1889, p. 35).
