No. 62 (Ep. CCLXIX)

AUGUSTINE TO MY SAINTLY AND REVERED
BROTHER AND FELLOW·PRIEST‚ NOBILIUSOE

So important is the ceremony to which your
brotherly affection invites me, that I should drag
my poor body to you with willingness, were it not
detained by weakness. I might have come, had it
not been winter ; Ι might have scorned the winter,
had I been young3 for either the glow of youth
would have endured the rigour of the season, or
else the glow of summer would have allayed the chill
of age. As it is, my saintly lord² my holy and revered
brother and fellow-priest, in winter I cannot bear
so lengthy a journey since I must bear with me the
frigidity of great age. I return the greeting that
I owe to your merits 3 my own welfare I commend
to your supplications, while beseeching the Lord
myself that peace and prosperity may follow upon
the dedication of so great a building.
