No, 41 (Ep. CLXXIX)

minutes Pelagius has already sent us not indeed any
portion of the minutes, but a kind of defence of him-
self, written by his own hand, in which he says he
has answered the objections of the Gauls.‘² In it, to
leave other matters out, he replied to the objection
made to him that he had said man could live without
sin and keep God's commandments if he wished to ;
his words are t “ I maintained that this power was
conferred upon him by God ; I did not maintain that
any person would be found who had never committed
a sin from his infancy to his old age, but that after
turning from sin by his own effort and with the help
of God’s grace he can live without sin, and that the
fact of having sinned does not prevent a man from
turning from it at a future date.''

In this reply of Pelagius your Reverence can dis· 8
cern that he has confessed that a man’s earlier life,
that is in infancy, is not without sin, but that he can
be turned by his own effort, assisted by the grace
of God, to the sinless life. Why then, in the book
I have replied to, does he allege that Abel lived a
life that was completely without sin? These are his
words about this point : ‘⁶ This can with justice be
said of those of whose good deeds and evil deeds alike
Scripture has no record ; 1)ι1ῖ 1ῖ would'assuredly have
recorded the sins of those whose righteousness it
records, if it had perceived that they had sinned at
all. But granted,’' he says, “ that in other ages the
great throng of rnen made Scripture neglect to
weave an account of the sins of every one: right
at the very beginning of the world, when there
were only four people in existence, what reason,'' he

of formal charges against Pelagius, to consider which the
Synod of Diospolis was called.
