The earliest editions (J ohannes de Amerbach, 1493 ;
Erasmus, 1528, 1569) possess only a bibliographical in—
terest. The editors of the Louvain edition of the complete
works of Augustine (1576) added 29 new letters, some of
which are found also as anecdota in the Supplementum to
Augustine by Hieronymus Vignier (Paris, 1654—1655). Α
separate edition of the Letters was given in 1668 by L. F.
Reinhart, who added seven more to the corpus. But an
epoch-making recension and re-arranging appeared just a
hundred years later, in the edition of the complete works
prepared by the Benedictines of St. Maur. They added
16 letters, making a total of 270, of which number 53 were
addressed to Augustine, the remainder being written by
him, sometimes in conjunction with others. These 270
the Maurist editors arranged 111 four groups, as nearly
chronological as they could place them. The first (Epp.

i. -ΧΧΧ.) belongs to the years p·bef01e his 91913ϊίοΠ to epis-

copal rank (A. D. 386—395); the second (Epp. xxxi. -οΧΧ111.)
to the years 396-410· ‚ the third (Epp. cxxiv.-ccxxxi.)
