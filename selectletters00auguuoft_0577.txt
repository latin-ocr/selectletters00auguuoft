No. 60 (Ep. CCLXH)

no divine orders for us to read. It is, indeed,
written that women should have “ modest apparel,”
and “ the wearing of gold '’ and “ the broidering
of the hair '’ a and other suchlike things, usually
employed either for empty show or to give allurement
to the body, are deservedly condemned. But there
is a kind of matronly dress, befitting a person's
station, distinct fr om the 83111161115 of a 11 idow, 11 111611
