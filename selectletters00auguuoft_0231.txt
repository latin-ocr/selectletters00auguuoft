being borne by Christians or are being made good
by Christians. As for the gain of souls‚ which we
long to secure even at the peril of our own body, we

To OLYMPIL'SJ MY EXCELLENT AND JUSTLY
DISTINGUISHED LORD AND SON WORTHY
OF MUCH HONOL‘R IN THE LOYE OF CHRIST,
AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

As soon as we heard of your well-deserved pro-
motion, although the report that reached us was still
very indefinite, we were confident that your attitude
towards the Church of G0d‚ of which we rejoice that
·you are truly a son, is no other than what you have
now revealed in your letter. Nevertheless‚ I write
to you, my excellent and justly distinguished lord and

and religion. To secure Olympius’s support Augustine sends
this letter by a priest passing through Hippo on his way
from Mileum to Rome. The letter is important too because,
according to Zosimus, Olympius merely used Christianity
as a cloak for his evil-doing, but Augustine's warm and
appreciative language here gives quite another view of his
character. If allowance must be made for Zosimus's ill-will
to all Christians, it must equally be made for Augustine's
want of personal knowledge of Olympius and the exag-
geratedly deferential tone of epistolary address.
