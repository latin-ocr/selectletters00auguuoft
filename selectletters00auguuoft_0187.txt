[THE BEGINNING OF THE NOTE OF ST. AUGUS-
TINE, CATHOLIC BISHOP, AGAINST CRIS-
PINUS⁰ THE SCHISMATIC]

You should have feared God at least, but since 1
11 was your desire to be feared like a man 111 your re-
baptizing of the Mappalians, why is a royal command
of no avail in the province, if a provincial command
has been of such avail on a private property ? If you
compare the persons concerned, you are the possessor,
he is emperor ; if you compare the positions of both,
you are on an estate, he 15 011 3 throne 3 if you com-
pare the motives of both, he aims at mending what 15
16111, you at rending what is one whole. But we are
not seeking to make you afraid of a man, for we could
make you pay up ten pounds of gold, according to the
imperial decrees. Or perhaps you have no money
With which to pay 1116 fine imposed on those who re-
baptize, after your great expenses 111 bribing people 10
accept re-baptism ? But, as I said, we are not seek-
ing to make you afraid of a 111311; 161 Christ rather
make you afraid. I want to know what answer you
would make to Him, if He were to say to you ε “ Cris-
pinus, was it a high price you paid for the fear of the
Mappalians, and was my death a small price to pay for
the love of all the nations ? W⁷as the money that was
counted out from your purse of greater value for the
re—baptizing of your serfs than the blood which flowed
from my side for the baptizing of my nations ? '’ Ι
know that if you were to give ear to Christ, you could
though the fine was remitted at Possidius's request (Aug. C.
Oresc. iii. 46-47; C. Litt. Petil. ii. 83 ς Possid. Vit. Any. 12).
