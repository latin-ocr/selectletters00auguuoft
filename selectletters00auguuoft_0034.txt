of a mythology which was at best an inadequate and
ill-fitting cloak for its original bareness and simplicity‚
though adopting Roman nomenclature and co'n-
structing its sanctuaries upon the model of those in
Roman use, this Punic paganism persisted behind and

by externa] conformity to the State religion as a
symbol of authority and by participation in its games,
its ceremonies‚ and its festivals.

What the Christian Church from the time of Con—
stantine had been steadily attempting to repress and
eradicate was this official Roman paganssm, the ally and
the expression of Roman imperialism. The distinc-
tion drawn above between the Punic basis of religion
and the veneer of terminology, mythology, and rite

‚ which accompanied the conquest and settlement,

must be borne in mind for the understandjng of
the Church's attitudes and policies towards pagan-
ism during the lifetime of Augustine. The reign of
Julian (361—363) had been followed by nearly twenty
years of vacillation and partia] tolerance of paganism

increasing severity the observance of pagan practices ;
sacrifices were proscribed‚ the immunities enjoyed by
priests and vestals were withdraw-n, the revenues and
property of pagan temples were confiscated‚ and the
statues of heathen deities were overthrown and their
temples closed. Those most affected by this legisla-
tion were naturally of the official class,the magistrates
