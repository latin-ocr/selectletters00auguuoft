For if these points 316 obscure, 111611 11 13 quite

they are 61631,11 13 incredible 11131 they could 11316

in secking 10 expound Galatiam, 3⁷ou reached 11131

in what they wrote. They are two quite different
questions, whether it e3⁷er accords with a good man's
character to lie, and whether a writer of the Hol3⁷

the whole authority of Scripture. J erome eventually accepted
Augustine’s view, which became generally accepted. A full
account of the. controversy is given in Lightfoot's com-
mentary on Galatiam, pp. 1528-132.
