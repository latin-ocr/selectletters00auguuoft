BIBLIOGRAPHY

from 411—4303 and the last group (Epp. ccxxxii-cclxx.)
contains the letters that cannot be dated.

The Maurist edition was several times reprinted, the
best-known reprint being that of Gaume (Paris, 1836).
Goldbaeher’s edition began to appear in 1895, after twenty-
two years of preparati0n3 in the Vienna Corpus Serip-
torum Eeel. Latinorum it forms vols. 34 (parts 1 and 2,
containing Epp. i.-xxx. and xxxi-cxxiii„ 1895, 1898),
44 (part 3, Epp. cxxiv.-clxxxiv., 1904) and 57 (Epp.
clxxv.-CCIXX., 1911). The final volume, containing pre-
faces and indices, was not issued until 1923, fifty years
after the editor had begun his long task.

Meanwhile, the original eorpus of 270 letters had been
increased by several fortunate, if meagre, discoveries.
Goldbacher inserted between Epp. clxx. and clxxi. a
portion of a letter preserved in the Commentary of
Primasius on the Apocalypse3 this fragment was re-
edited after Goldbacher by Haussleiter in Zahn’s For-
schunyen zur Gesehielzte d. neutest. Karions, fasc. iv. (Er-
langen, 1891); and also two letters (Epp. clxxxiv. and
ccii.A) published by G. Bessel in 1732 and 1733. F urther,
Goldbacher found two letters (Epp. xcii.A and clxxiii.A)
which he first published in Wiener Studien, Bd. xvi.
(1894) pp. 72-77. In the Revue Be'ne'dictine, vol. xiij.
(1896) pp. 481-486, Dom Germain Morin published the
text of an unprinted letter addressed to Valentinus, abbot
of Hadrumetum (see No. 50 infra), of which, by the dis-
covery of another manuscript, he was able to give a better
text in the same review, vol. xviii. (1901) pp. 241-244.
This letter has unfortunately found no place in Gold-
bacher’s edition.

In the present year two small volumes have been an-
nounced (S. Eusebii Hieronymi et Aurelii Auyustini
epistulae mutuae, ed. J os. Schmid, and S. Aurelii Augustini
liber cle ridendo Deo, seu Epistula 147, ed. Michael
Schmaustlorileyium Patri-sticum, Nos. xxii. and xxiii.).
Of these only the second has appeared at the time of going
to press 3 it is a faithful reproduction of Goldbacher’s text,
with a slight introduction and the minimum of textual notes.
