ΝΟ. 40 (Ep. CLXXIV)

Seeing, then, that my intention was prevented from
being carried out because of those persons who were
able to have access to some of the books before
I wanted them to, Ι broke off my dictation and
abandoned it, thinking to voice my complaint in
some other work of mine, so as to let those who
could, know that those same books were not pub-
lished by me, but were taken out of my hands before
they seemed to me fit for publication by me. But
compelled by the most urgent demands of many of
my brethren and most of all by your command, Ι
have taken the trouble to bring to completion, with
the help of God, a work on which I have expended
so much effort, and now by our son and dear fellow-
deacon I am sending them to your Grace, and hand-
ing them over for anyone to hear, read, or copy,
corrected as well as I could, not as well as I would,
in case they might differ too much from those copies
which were stolen from me and are already in circula-
tion. If I could have stuck to what I intended in
them, they should have contained the same opinions,
but should certainly have been much less obscure
and more easy to read, 35 far as the difficulty of
explaining such weighty matters and my own ability
allowed it. Now there are some people who possess
the first four or rather five books without the in-
troductions and the twelfth without the last portion,
which is of 3 fair length ς but if this edition happens
to come to their notice, they will be able to make
all the corrections, if they have the wish and the
ability. Ι beg you by all means to give instructions
for the placing of this letter at the head of those
books, but apart from them. Pray for me.
