ΝΟ. 521· (Ep. XCI)

country of yours we have experienced not so much
‘⁴ vn’th what men it has flowered '' as “ with what arms
it has blazed,'' nay rather, not “ arms,'' but ‘⁴ fires,’'
and “ not blazed,'' but “ set on fire.⁷’ If the heinous
offence before us were left unpunished with no
adequate chastisement of the miscreants, do you
think that you would leave your country in full flower?
Flowers indeed, but promising thorns, certainly not
fruit! Just make the comparison and see whether you
prefer your country to flower by practising piety or by
escaping punishment, by the discipline of character
or by the protection of violence3 make the com-
parison and see whether in love for your country you
outdo us, whether your desire to behold it in full
flower is greater and more genuine than ours.

Look for 3 moment at those very books “ On the 3
State '' a froin which you imbibed that sentiment of
a. loyal subject, that “ to good men there is no limit
or end of devotion to their country.'’ Look at them,
I pray you, and notice the praise with which frugality
and sels-control are extolled, and fidelity to the
marriage-hond, and chaste, honourable, and upright
character. When a country 15 distinguished for 111656
qualities,it may truly be said to be in full flower. Now,
it 15 111 1116 churches that are springing up through-
out the world, in the sacred lecture-roonis, one might
say, of the nations‚ that these moral qualities are
being taught and learned, and most especially the
piety with which worship is paid to the true and
truthful God, W ho 1101 only commands men to under-
take, but also gives them the power to perform, all
those things by which the human spirit is trained
and fitted for fellowship with God and for dwelling in
the everlasting heavenly country. It is for that
