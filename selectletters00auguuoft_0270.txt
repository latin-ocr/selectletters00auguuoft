TUNATO ET QUI TECUM SUNT FRATRIBUS
AUGL'STINUS IN DOMINO SALUTEM

Faventium bene novit. sanctitas tua, qui Paratia-
nensis saltus conductor fuit. Is cum ab eiusdem
possessionis domino nescio quid sibi metueret, ad
Hipponiensem confugit ecclesiam, et ibi erat, ut
confugientes solent, expectans quo modo per inter-
cessionem nostram sua negotia terminaret. Qui, ut
saepe fit, per dies singulos minus minusque sollicitus
et quasi adversario cessante securus, cum ab amico
suo de cena egrederetur, subito raptus est a Floren-
tino quodam‚ ut dicunt, comitis officiali per arma-
torum manum, quanta eis ad hoc factum sufficere visa

originally only wooded and pasture land (“saltus proprie

11), were vast estates as great as, sometimes larger than, the
territory of a city (Gr-om. ed. Lachmann, p. 53). At the centre
lay the villa of the owner, surrounded by the houses of the
workers, and this settlement was also called villa. All or
part of the saltas was let to a conductor, below whom were
the coloni, owing him certain services. The domain itself was
often called fundus or lati fundi, but the word fundus was
applied too to the smaller portions. See Reid, Municipal-
{ties of the Roman Empire, pp. 319 ff.; Boissier‚ L'Afrique
Romame, p. 165.
