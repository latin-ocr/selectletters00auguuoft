INTRODUCTION

of the Catholic prince to establish Catholic unity.
The action of the emperors in using force to destroy
heresy he thereafter xigorously defended, although
in actual practice he sought as far as lay in his power
to prevent the infliction of the extreme penalties of
torture and death. Yet his theory of the coercion
of heretics contains in germ the whole system of
spiritual tyranny which came to a full development
in the Inquisition‚ and his authority was invoked for
the perpetration of cruelties from which he certainly
would have shrunk with horror. His doctrine of the
Church provided the basis for the mediaeval concep-
tion of an omnipotent institution, capable of using
the secular State as the executive of its declared will,
possessed of an essential and inalienable prerogative
as the Body and Kingdom of Christ, and exercising
a divine right in its organization and in the suppres-
sion of all free inquiry and free speech. But he
never completely resolved the inconsistency between
his theory of the Church Catholic and his theological
doctrine of Grace ; on the one hand, the Church is
the visible Society bound together by the Sacra-
ments and the hierar-chy 3 on the other, it is the sum
total of all those who5 whether within the visible
Church or without, are predestined by God to eternal
life. Between these two his thought wavered, and
he transfers to the visible Society much of the ideal
character of the final Kingdom of God. In this
identification of the Kingdom of God with an organ-
ized ecclesiastical government he supplied the frame-
Work for the mediaeval Church, but the real disparity
between the hierarchical idea and his doctrine of Grace
was not realized and faced until the days of Wyclif
and Hus and the Reformation.
