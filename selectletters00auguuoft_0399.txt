ΝΟ. 43 (Ep. cxci)

you have any adequate conception yourself of the
amount of good you have done to us in writing as you
did, but take our word for it 3 for just as you can bear

against its enemieS, uttered by one whom those
same enemies boasted of as an influentia] supporter
of their cause? Or is there anything that should

it is given, against those to whom it is either not
given or by whom it is so ungraciously received when
given, since by the secret and righteous judgement of
God it is not given them to accept it graciously ?
Wherefore, my venerable lord and holy brother 2

cherished in the love of Christ, although you do an
excellent service in writing on this question to the
brethren before whom its supporters are in the habit
of boasting of your friendship, yet this larger duty
