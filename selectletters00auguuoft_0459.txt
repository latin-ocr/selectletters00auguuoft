No. 49 (Ep. ccxl)

in everything needed for the wants that pass away.
It follows, then, that even what a man or woman
bestows upon the inmates of the monastery, be they
daughters or relatives, whether the gift be clothing or
any other things that may be regarded as necessaries,
must not be received in secret, but it must lie in the
power of the superior to put it to the common stock
and to hand it over to any inmate that needs it.b If
anyone conceal a gift bestowed on her, let her be
sentenced and condemned for theft.

Let your garments be washed, either by yourselves 13
or by washer-women, at the discretiori of the superior,
so that excessive solicitude for clean raiment may
not infect the soul with inward vileness.c Let the
bathing of the body and the use of baths not be
incessant, but be granted at the usual interval o‘f
time, that is, once a month. If, how ever, the need
arising from any illness demands the w ashing of the
body, let it not be too long postponed, and let it be
done without murmuring for medical reasons3 if
anyone refuse, let her do at the command of the
superior what needs to be done for health's sake.
But if she wishes it and it does not happen to be for
her good, she must not give in to her desire, for
there are times when what is pleasant is thought to
be beneficial, even though it really do harm. Finally,
if a handmaid of God has some hidden pain in the
body, and tells what ails her, she should be believed
without hesitation3 but still, if there be uncertainty
