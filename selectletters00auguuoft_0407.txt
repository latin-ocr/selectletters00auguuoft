TO VALERIU& MY DISTINGUISHED AND JUST-
LY RENOWNED LORD AND SON WELL-
BELOVED IN THE LOVE OF CHRIST, AUGUS-
TINE SENDS GREETING IN THE LORD

I have long been disappointed that, after writing 1
several times, I have not had the honour of receiving
any reply from your Excellency. Now quite unex-
pectedly I have received three letters from your
Benignity, one of them, not exclusively to me, by
the hands of my fellow-bishop Vindemialis‚c and not
long afterwards two by the hands of my fellow-priest
Firmus.d That holy man, with whom I have ties of
the most intimate and affectionate nature, as you may
have heard from him, talked at length to me about your
Excellency and gave me such a true conception of you,
as he found you in ‘⁶ the tender mercies ofChrist‚'’ θ that
he outdid not only the letters brought to me by the
afore-mentioned bishop or by himself, but even those
I was complaining of not receiving. And his account
of you was all the more pleasant in that he told me

above), accusing Augustine of denying the divine institution
of marriage; Augustine thereupon added a second book re-
futing the charge. Valerius is addressed also in Ep. ccvi.‚ a
recommendation of a bishop called Felix.
