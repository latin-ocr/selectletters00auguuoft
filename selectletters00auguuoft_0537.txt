No, 55 (Ep. ccxxxii)

has laid low all the empty swellings of his pride and
prostrated himself in meekness and humility to receive
God as his teacher ἓ J -

Since then we have first to be reduced from the 6
vanity of pride to humility, so that rising thence we
may acquire real exaltation, it was impossible for us
to have communica-ted to us this spirit (the more
glorious for its very gentleness) whereby our un-
governableness is subdued by persuasion instead of
by force, had not this VVord——through VVhom God
the Father reveals Himself to the angels,a Who is
His strength and wisdom, VVhom the human heart,
blinded by the desire for things visible‚ was unable
to perceive—-condescended to act out His part in
human form and exhibit His being in such a way as
to make mankind more afraid of being uplifted by the
pride of man than of being brought low by the
example of God. So the Christ Who is preached
throughout-the world is not a Christ Who is adorned
With an earthly kingdom, nor a Christ rich in earthly
possessions‚ nor a Christ shining with any earthly
splendour‚ but Christ crucifiedss’ This was a matter
for ridicule at first by proud nations and still is to
a remnant, but it was a matter for saith first to a
few, now to nations, for then according to the faith
of the few and in spite of the ridicule of the nations,
when Christ crucified was preaclied, the lame
walked‚ the dumb spoke, the deaf heard, the blind
saw, and the dead rose again.⁰ Thus at last conviction
was brought to the pride of the world that nothing
in the world itself was more potent than divine
humility‚ so that under the protection of that divine
example the most wholesome human humility may
find shelter against the scornful assaults of pride.
