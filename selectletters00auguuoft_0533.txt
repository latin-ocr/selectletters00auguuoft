No. 55 (Ep. ccxxxii>

their attacks and their laws against the very idols for
whose sake they were in the habit of slaying Chris-
tians3 and you see the most eminent dignitary of
this noble Empire lay aside his crown and bow in
supplication before the tomb of the fishernian Peter.‘¹
All these things were long, long ago foretold to 4
be coming to pass by the testimony of Holy Scripture,
which has now come into the hands of everyone:
all of then] have happened, to our joy and to the
greater strengthening of our saith as we find the
Holy Scripture foretold them with a more imposing
authority. Are we then, Ι ask you, to imagine that
it is God's judgement alone, which those same Books
foretell to their readers as deciding between the
believing and the unbelieving——are we then to imagine
that this judgement of God's alone will not come
about, when all those other things came about just as
they were foretold? Yea, verily, just as they all
came about, so it too will come. Nor will there be any
man of our times who at that judgement will be able
to put forward any defence for being an unbeliever,
when the name of Christ is on every nian's lips z the
righteous invokes it for justice, and the perjurer for
deceit and the king for rule and the soldier for
battle and the husband for establishing his authority
and the wife as a sign of her submission and the
father for his commands and the son for his obedi-
ence, the master for his lordship and the servant
for his service, the humble man for piety and the
proud man for ambition, the rich man when he gives
away and the poor man when he receives, the
drunkard in his cups and the beggar at the gate, and

τοῦ ἁλιέως καὶ τοῦ σκηνοποιοῦ τρέχουσι καὶ βασιλεῖς καὶ ὕπατοι
καὶ στρατηγοί.
