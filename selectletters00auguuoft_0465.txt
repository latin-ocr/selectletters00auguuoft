No, 49 (Ep. ccxl)

Let the superior be obey ed like a mother, with all 15
due honour, so that 3ou offend not God through
offending her3 much more should you obey 1116
priest who has charge of 3 ou all. Upon the superior
particularly 11111 fall the responsibility of seeing that
all these regulations are carried out and, if anything
is not carried out, of not carelessly passing over the
offence‚ but of applying the remedy 10 11631 and
correct it ; she may, further, refer to the priest-in-
charge any matter that goes beyond her ‘province or

maintaining discipline and fearful to impose it 3 and
although both are necessary, yet let her endeavour
to 116 more loved by you than feared, always bearing
in mind that she has to render an account of you 10

have compassion on her as well as on yourselves,
because the higher her position is among you, the
greater is the risk she runs.

with love, as those whose affection 13 361 upon spiritual
beauty and who are fragrant 111111 1116 311661 savour
of Christ in your good conduct‚⁶ not as bondswomen
