No. 54 (Ep. ccxxxi)

just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoeyer things are of good report 3 if
there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think
on these things. Those things, which ye have both
learned and received and heard and seen in 1116, do ;
and the God of peace shall 116 with you. ” a So the
other things he mentioned above he included under
1116 w‘ord‘ virtues 531 ing “If there be an3 1111116 ”;
what he meant b3 1116 11 01 (15,ί ‘w h 115061 61· things are
of good report‚' ’116 follow ed up by the singffle 311111Ηο1111-

ate phrase,“ If there be any praise.'' So his words,
“ If I yet pleased men, I should not be 1116 servant
of Christ,'' are to be understood in this way, 35 if
he had said, “ If I were doing the good I do with
the motive of receiving human praise, I should be
‘ swelling with the lust for praise.' '' The apostle
wanted therefore to please 311 111611, and found joy in
pleasing those whom he edified in Christ by receiving
their praise, not those whose praise made him swell
within himself. Why should I not therefore find
pleasure in being praised by you, when you are (unless
I am mistaken in you) a good man and bestow your
praise upon the things which you admire and which
it is profitable and wholesome for you to admire, even
if they be lacking in me ? This benefits not only you,
but me too, for if they are lacking in me, it is whole-
some for me to be shamed and inflamed with desire
to acquire them. And so the qualities I recognize in
your praises as my own I rejoice in possessing and in
having you love them and me for their sake ; 111056 011
1116 011161· hand that Ι fail to recognize as mine I yearn
to acquire, not only in order to possess them for
myself, but also to keep those who have a genuine love
for me from being deluded when they praise me.
