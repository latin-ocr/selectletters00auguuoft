No, 24 (Ep. xci)

the nature of the State, establishes our point that by
imitating the gods—not, to be sure, true gods, but
false and fabricated gods—the most depraved of men

become still worse.
But it may be obj ected that all those ancient tales 5

about the life and character of the gods are to be
understood and interpreted far differently by men
of vidsdom. Thus, in fact, we heard just the other
day harmless interpretations of this kind read to the
people gathered in the templesfl Tell me, is the
human race so blind to truth as not to perceive facts
so evident and open? In so many places Jove is
exhibited committing his numerous adulteries by
painters, founders smiths‚ sculptors‚ writers, reciters,
actors, singers and dancers3 what was the use of
reciting, in his own Capitol at any rate, decrees for-
bidding such sins? If, with no one to forbid them,
these foul deeds that are the culmination of turpitude
and ungodliness are enthusiastically acclaimed by
the people‚ worshipped in the teniples‚ applauded in
the theatres b ; if, when victims are sacrificed to their
perpetrators‚ even the poor are despoiled of their
flock, and when actors represent them in dance and
action, the rich lavish their fortunes on thern—are
countries to be described as in flower ? Such flowers
as these certainly do not owe their birth to fruitful
soil or to any bounteous virtue ; they have found a
worthy parent in that goddess Flora‚⁶ whose theatrical
games are celebrated with such unusually abandoned
and shameless vileness that anyone may understand
what is the nature of a divinity that cannot be con-
ciliated unless there perish as victims on her altars
