ΝΟ. 42 (Ep. CLXXXIX)
asked of him what they should do, and he made

answer to them ε “ Do violence to no man, neither
accuse any falsely, and be content with your wages.''‘¹
To be sure, when he commanded them to be content
with their military wages, he did not forbid them to
serve as soldiers.

They have a greater place before God, who 5
abandon all these worldly employments to serve him
with the strictest sels-discipline and chastity ; ‘⁶ but
everyone,’' as the apostle says, “ hath his proper
gift of God, one after this manner and another after
that.'' b There are some, then, who by praying for you
fight against your invisible foes, while you by fighting
for them are striving against the visible barbarians.
Would that there were one faith in all, for there would
be less of striving and the devil with his angels would
be more easily overcome ! But as it is necessary in
this world that the citizens of the kingdom of heaven
should be harassed by temptations among erring
and irreverent men so that they may be exercised
and tried as gold in the furnace,c we ought not before
the appointed time to desire to live with the saints
and righteous alone, so that we may deserve to re-
ceive this blessedness in its own due time.

Think, then, of this point first of all w hen you are 6
arming for battle, that y our strength, ev en that of the
body, is a gift from God3 in this way you will not
think of using God' s gift against God. For when
saith is pledged, it is to be kept even with the enemy
against whom you are waging war 3 how much more
vm'th the friend, for whose sake you are fighting ἱ
You ought to have peace as the object of your choice
and war only as the result of necessity, so that God
may deliver you from the necessity and preserve you
