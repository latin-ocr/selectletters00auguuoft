No. 49 (Ep. ccxi)

equal importance, but to each one according as she
has need. For in the Acts of the Apostles you read
that “ they had all things common, and distribution
was made to every man according as he had need.'’ α
Let those of you who had any possessions in the
world before you entered the monastery willingly
consent that they become common property3 let
those, on the other hand, who had none, not seek in
the monastery for things they could not have outside
it, but yet let what is needful be conceded to their
weakness, even if their poverty, while they were
outside, was such that they could not procure even the
bare necessities of life. Nevertheless, let them not
think themselves fortunate only because they have
procured such food and raiment as they were unable
to procure outside.

And let them not go about with head erect because 6
they are associating with those whom they did not
dare to approach outside, but let them lift up their
hearts and not seek earthly goods, in case the
monasteries become of service to the rich and not to
the poor, while in them the rich are bowed down with
humility and the poor in them puffed up with vanity.
But again, let not those who in the world considered
themselves something, hold in scorn their sisters
who have com'e to that holy fellowship from poverty ³²3
let them endeavour to take greater pride in the
fellowship of their poor sisters than in the rank of their
wealthy parents. And let them not exalt themselves,
if they have made some contribution from their own
resources to the common life, lest they grow more
vain of their wealth because they are sharing it with
the monastery, than if they were enjoying the use
of it in the world3 for every other kind of iniquity
