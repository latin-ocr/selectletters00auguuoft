No. 11 (Ep. CLXXIX)

Why need I dilate upon the point to your Holiness, 5
when I already realize that Ι 3111 wea13 mg 3·‚ou es-
pecially as 3ou listen to my letter through an in-
terpreter Ρα If3 ou lov e Pelagius, ma3 he too C>103 e 3 ou,
or rather decei3e himself and not 3ou. ¹ For 33hen
3ou hear him confessing God’ 5 81306 and God’ 5 help,
3ou think he means the same as 3 ou do, 33 ho under-
stand them 111 1116 118111 of 1116 Catholic rule of saith,
because you are unacquainted with 33 hat 116 1135
written in his book. For 11115 reason l 11316 56111 1116
book itself and the reply I 111016 10 11; from these
your Reverence may 566 what grace or help of God
he speaks of, when 1116 obj ection 15 made to him 11131
116 15 speaking of something opposed 10 1116 81306 and
help of God. Open his eyes 111611 by teaching and
exhorting 111111 and praying for the salvation he ought
10 have in Christ, so that he may confess that 81306
of God the 5311115 316 proved 10 have confessed‚ when
they sought 111056 11111185 from the Lord which He
commanded 1116111 10 56611, for those things would
have not been commanded unless 10 1116 end that our
will should be revealed, nor would they be asked for,
unless to the end that the weakness of our will should
have the help of Him who commanded them.

Let the question be openly put to him whether he 6
approves of praying the Lord that we fall not into sin.
If he disapproves of it, let the apostle be read in his
ears, in the 11 ords,‘ ‘Now I pray to God that ye do
no 6111” b· ,but if he does appr 03 e of it, let him openly
preach that grace 33 hich 3551515 115, 50 that he himself
may be kept from doing much 6111. For it is by this
grace of God through J esus Christ our Lord that all
those who are delivered, are delivered, since no one
can be delivered in any other way than through it.
