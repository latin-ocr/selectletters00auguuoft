No. 51 (Ep. ccxx)

the great advantage the work you were doing would
» be to the churches of Christ, if you pursued it with
the sole purpose of protecting them from the hostile
attacks of barbarians,‘z so that they might live, as
the apostle says, ‘⁶ a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty‚'' b while you yourself would
seek from this world nothing but what was necessary
for the maintenance of your own life and that of your
household, girding yourself with the chastest con-
tinence, and wearing along with the armour of the
body the surer and stronger defence of the armour
of the spirit.

When, in consequence, we were rejoicing in this 4
design of yours, you sailed for Italy and you married
a wife⁶; your sailing was an act of obedience,
which you ow ed, according 10 1116 apos 5,116 to‘ ‘the
higher pow ers' '‘²‘ ‚but 3 ou 11011111 not h 1·316 mariied
a wife if you had not been ov ercome by desire and
abandoned the continence you took upon 3ourself.
When I learned of this, I confess I was 11111Πά61-
struck 111111 31113Ζ61116111, 3et in some measure I
found consolation for my grief in the fact that I
heard you had refused to marry 1161 1111111 5116 turned
CatholiC. But in spite of that, the heresy of those
who deny the true Son of God has acquired such
influence in your home that it was by them that
your daughter was baptized. If 1116 report that
reached us was not untrue (and would 10 Heaven
that it were !)‚ that those same heretics have even
re-baptized maidens consecrated to God, what
fountains of tears we should need now to bewail

Pelagia‚ an Arian, but she abandoned this heresy before her
marriage, only 10 return 10 11 afterwards.
