in the universe, its origin and its relation to the
Creator. Against Pelagianism Augustine was chiefly
engaged in discussing the nature of 6111 35 11 15 1113111-
fested in the heart of man, the corruption of the

human will, man's responsibility for all the sin that ι

exists in the world, and the place of human freedom
in God’s scheme of salvation. Partly deriving from
those Christological heresies which regarded J esus 35

drawing upon the Stoic doctrine of human perfecti-

Pelagiam‘sm was an outbreak of paganism within the

Celestius was condemned 3 the second, in Palestine,
where Pelagius's specious arguments misled two
Eastern synods into approval of his 6356 ; and the
third, at Rome, where at first the Roman bishop,
Zosimus, pronounced Pelagius orthodox and after-
wards, under pressure from the Church at Carthage,
declared his theories anathema. But the problem,
once ventilated, continued to trouble the XVestern
Church, and even in his own day Augustine found
many critics of his system as he has 601111111101151)ν
