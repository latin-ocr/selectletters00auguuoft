INTRODUCTION

1111165, to seize hold of a word or phrase in an oppon-
ent's letter, and to play upon the word or the idea for
the duration of his reply 3 a he has a fondness for jingle
and assonance, and many of his most quoted phrases
owe their popularity as much to their balance, point,
and rhyme, as to their meaning. But even granting
all this, we fall short of accuracy in describing his
lang-uage as “ rhetorical '' and in crediting his early
and pre-Christian studies with a permanent and
unmistakable moulding of his style. In realsty, if
he be compared with his contemporaries, none has
emerged so far from enslavement to rhetoric ; no one
of them shows less solicitude than he for the frills and
flourishes of mere ornament. Of a sober and intro-
spective nature, he is too much in earnest about the
truth to be anything but direct, weighty, and un-
adorned. He made Christian Latin a more pliant and
forceful speech than any of his predecessors except
that other African, Tertullian. Under stress of ,1115
ideas or his emotions it becomes a grave and sonorous
vehicle for great and moving thoughtS, and only at
occasional moments does he condescend to think as
much of his method and manner of utterance as of his
message. Rhetoric formed indeed the chief staple of
contemporary education and Augustine did not
escape from the heritage of his age, yet in many re-
spects he is one of the greatest, as well as the last, of
the masters of Latin eloquence.

transition‚ he stood at the boundary-line of old and new
and linked hands with both. In him the contribution
