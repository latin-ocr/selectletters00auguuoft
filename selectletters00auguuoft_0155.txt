No. 11 (Ep. XXXIV)

If that is the kind of thing you approve of, let your
clergy and those who are to carry through his sanctifi-
cation instigate him to fulfil all his vow within his
eight days.a

But the Lord's right hand is strong to restrain his 4
rage from that unfortunate and lonely widow and,
by means best known to Himself‚ to frighten him
from his crimina] purpose. Yet what was Ι to do,
when I was so pained and indignant, but at least
speak my mind ? Are they, indeed, to do such things
and I be told to hold my peace ? The Lord deliver
me from such folly, that when, by His apostle‚ He
commands me and says that those who teach what
they ought not, ought to be rebukedb by the bishop,
Ι should be silent from dread of their indignation.
In wanting this heinous crime to find permanent
record in the public registers, my intention surely
was to prevent anyone, especially in other towns
where I may have a chance to deplore these deedS,
from imagining that I am inventing any detail, for
even here in Hippo it is already being said that
Proculianus ⁰ did not issue the order which the public
officials have recorded as his.

What more temperate course could we pursue 5
than to take action in a matter of such seriousness
through you, a man invested with the most eminent
rank and, at the same time, possessing great circum-
spection, goodwill and equanimity? So I beseech
you, as Ι have already done by our brethren‚ good
and honourable men, whom I sent to your Ex-
cellency‚ to have the kindness to inquire whether
it was not this order of Proculianus recorded by the

“ order '’ is apparently that made by Proculianus to the
priest Victor to receive the young man in question.
