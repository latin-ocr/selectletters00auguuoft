No, 19 (Ep. LXVI)

hear more such questions and be warned by your very
property how impious are the words you and your
like speak against Christ. For if you reokon that
by human law you have a sure title to what you
have bought with your own money, how much
surer by divine law is Christ's title to what He has
bought with His own blood! And yet He will
have an unshakable title to evei-ything, for it is
written of Him z “ He shall 11316 dominion from
sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of
the earth.” a But how do you expect vn'th any assur-
ance that you will not lose what you think you have
bought in Africa, when you assert that Christ has lost
the whole world and has been left for Africa alone ?
But why multiply words ἓ If it was of 111611 own 2
free will that the Mappalians went 0161 10 your 00111-
11111111011, 161 1116111 11631 115 both, our 5131611161115 being
written down and, after being attested by our signa-
tures, translated into Punic for them 3 and without
any sear of intiniidation let them choose what they
want. For from what we say it will be made 01631
whether they are abiding in falsehood from compul-
51011 01 316 holding fast the truth of their own ehoice.
For if they do not understand what is involved, how
had you the boldness to take thern over to your side
with no understanding of the points at issue Ρ But if
they do understand, let them, as I said, hear us both
and do as they wish. Further‚ if there are any con-
gregations who 11316 001116 over to us and whom you
believe to have done so under compulsion from their
overlords‚ let the 531116 0011156 be followed there too :
let them hear us both and 0110056 what they please.
But if you are unwilling to do this, who can fail to see
that your party has no confidenee in the truth ? Yet
