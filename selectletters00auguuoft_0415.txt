should not wish you to endure henceforward such
sufferings as you have endured in the past, my wish
is yet greater that you may not have endured them
without some change of your life for the better.

TO CELESTINE,‘¹ MY LORD MOST SAINTLY AND
HOLY FATHERb REVERED WITH ALL DUE
AFFECTION, AUGUSTINE SENDS GREETING
IN THE LORD

First of all I pay my tribute of congratulation to l
your mei-its that the Lord our God has placed you in
that apostolic chair with (as we are informed) no
division among His people. In the next place, I
lay before your Holiness the state of affairs with us;
so that you may come to our assistance not only by
praying for us, but also by giving us your counsel and
assistance,c for I am writing to your Holiness under
deep affliction ε by my lack of foresight and caution
I have brought a great disaster upon certain members
of Christ in our neighbourhood, though I had in-
tended only their benefit.

Fussala d is the name of a small town not far from 2

construction of a fortress there under Justinian. In Oiv.
Dea· xxii. 8. 6 is mention of a private estate near Fussala,
on which the owner had built a chapel in which he placed soil
from the Holy Sepulchre. The bishop mentioned below,
Antoninus, was present at the Council of Mileve in 416 (Ep.
clxxvi.⁹ title), but in view of his misdeeds Augustine assumed
control himself (ἓ 5, cf. Ep. ccxxiv.)‚ and retained it till his
death. Castellum is defined by Augustine himself in De
Oonsensu Evany. iii. 25. 712 “ castellum . . . non absurde
accipimus etiam villam potuisse appellari.”
