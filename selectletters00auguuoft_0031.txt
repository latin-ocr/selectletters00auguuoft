and on them of a small, exclusive, and enormously
wealthy class ofproprietors alongside a vast population
of serfs, made it possible to have considerable material
progress without a corresponding extension of culture.
Since the reign of Trajan, the soldiers of the Third
Legion who on discharge from service settled in the
veteran-colonies were almost all of African birth, and
