ΝΟ. 47 (Ep. cclx)

see contrary to the statutes of the Fathersfl Or
should anyone be so extreme an advocate of severity or
of gentleness as either to exact absolutely no punish-
ment from those who do not seem to merit deprivation
of the honour of the bishop’s office, or on the other
hand to deprive of the honour of that office those who
have been judged to deserve some punishment ἓ ⁰
There are on record among the judgements given 8

by the Apostolic See itself, or its confirmations of the
judgements of others, precedents for not depriving
certain bishops, tried for certain offences, of their
episcopal rank, and yet for not leaving them alto-
gether unpunished. Not to seek out examples that
are far from our own day, I shall mention some os
recent date. Hear the protest of Priscus,c a bishop
of the province of Caesarea⁰l : ‘⁴ Either the office of
Primate ought to be open to me too, or else I ought
not to retain my episcopal office.'' Let the protest
be heard of another bishop of the same province,
Victor, who when left in the same fault as PriscuS, is
not allowed to receive communion from any bishop
unless within his own diocese—let his protest, I
repeat, be heard: “ Either Ι ought to communicate
anywhere, or else I ought not to communicate even
in my own district.'' Let the protest be heard of a
third bishop of the same province, Laurentius, and

‘² Caesarea was one of the two portions of Mauretania,
which was incorporated in the Empire by Caligula in Aa), 40.
About 292 Diocletian divided Caesarea into two, giving the
new portion the name of ΗΙαῑινρίαηὶα Sitifiensis, roughly
corresponding to the western part of modern Algeria, while
the other, Caesarea, corresponds to the eastern part of
Morocco. Caesarea takes its name from the town of Iol, a
Phoenician colony, which J uba II. called Caesarea in honour
of Julius Caesar. The modern name is Cherchel.
