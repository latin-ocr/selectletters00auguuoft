No, 51 (Ep. ccxx)

men's lives, but of conquering “ principalities and
powers and spiritual wickedness‚''a that is, the devil
and his angels.b For these are the enemies whom the
holy vanquish‚ enemies they cannot see3 and yet
they vanquish the enemies they cannot see by
vanquishing the obj ects of their senses. But to that
kind of life I am prevented from urging you, for your
wife stands in the way, and without her consent you
cannot adopt a life of continence ; because, although
you had no right to marry her after what you said
at Tubunae, yet she became your wife in all inno-
cence and single—mindedness, knowing nothing of
your declaration. Yet would that you could persuade
her to continence, so that with nothing in your way
you could render unto God what you know you owe
Him l But if you cannot arrange that with her,
preserve at least your conjugal chastity and ask
God, Who 6311 “ bring you out of your distresses‚'' 10
grant that you may be able to do sooner or later
what you find impossible now. But yet, in order 10
love God, you must give up loving the world ; in your
warfare (if you have still 10 be engaged in it) keep the
faith and ensue peace ; use this world’s goods 10 do
good deeds, and 10 obtain this world's goods do not
do evil deeds —in these duties a wife is not a
hindrance, or ought not to be.

I have written thus to you, my beloved son, 31 1116
bidding of the love wherexw‘th I love you, not in the
way of this world, but in God’s way. And when I
recall to mind the words of Scripture, “ Reprove a
wise man and he will love 11166 ; reprove a fool and
he will hate thee more,''⁰ I had to think of you as
surely not a fool, but a wise man.
