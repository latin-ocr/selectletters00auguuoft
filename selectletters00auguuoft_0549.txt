No. 57 (Ep. CCXLVI)

is condemned, let him come to himself again and
observe this same principle in dealing with those
attached to him 3 let him refrain from chastising a
servant who steals ; let him utter no complaint of an
abusive son and no threats to an offensive neighbour.
Would he be acting justly in doing any of these
things, if all those who do him some injury are
driven to perform such actions, not by any fault of
their own, but by Fate ? If, however, from his
personal rights and his responsibility as the head of
a household, he exhorts to good those persons who
for the time being are under his authority, deters
them from doing evil and commands them to carry
out his will, honours those who obey his nod, punishes
those who set him at naught, renders thanks to the
obliging, and hates those who are ill-disposed——shall
I expect him to argue against Fate, when I find him
proclaiming, not in words but in deeds, such con-
victions as to make him almost appear to be breaking
with his own hands all the tables of the astrologers
over their own heads ?

So then, if these few remarks do not appease your
thirst for information and you desire on this subject
a book that will take a longer time to read, you must
await with patience until I have a free interval, and
ask God to be pleased to grant me both the leisure
and the ability to satisfy your mind on this question.
Yet my eagerness will be increased, if your charity
does not grudge 'ro write often and remind me, and
also to reply informing me what you think about this
letter.
