No. 39 (Ep. CLXXIII)

to compromise the person of Donatus, priest of
Mutugenna,a all the less ought the person of
Caecilian, even if some degree of evil had been
detected in him, to compromise Christian unity,
which is not confined to the single village of Mutu-
genna, but is spread abroad throughout the world.
But see, we shall do as you have desired3 we 8

shall treat with you as if your bishops had not said,
“ One case does not compromise another case, nor
one person another person.'' Do you find out what
they ought to have replied to that point, when the
objection was made to them of the case and person
of Primianus‚b who although he joined the others in
anathematizing those who had anathematized him,
nevertheless received back with their former honours
those whom he had anathematized and cursed, and
chose rather to recognize and accept, than to abolish
and breathe scorn upon,⁰ the baptism given by
dead men (for of them it was said in that famous

in 404 the aid of the secular arm, and Primianus was dis-
possessed, but soon returned, playing a prominent part
in the Conference of 411. This marked a definite stage
in the history of Donatism, and Primianus's power was quite
broken.

⁶ Eaesuffio is a late word, properly “to breathe out,”
‘⁴ blow out,'’ as Cael. Aur. C'hron. 4. 3 ‘⁶ exsufflatis omnibus
quae de se admiserint'’; then, naturally, it came to imply
scorn (Iren.—Lat. i. 13. 4 “ exsufflantes et catathemizantes
eum ’'). In the baptism of the young, exsufflation was part
of the ceremony of exorcism from very early in the Church's
history (Augustine calls it an ‘⁶ antiquissimam Ecclesiae tradi-
tionem,'’ De vat. ii. 29. 51); then, since in re-baptizing
Catholic Christians the Donatists ‘⁶ exsufflated ” the previous
baptism (“ iterata baptismata, exsufflata sacramenta‚'' Ep.
xliii. 243 “ fidelis si veniat, exsufflant et rebaptizant,'’ Ep.
lii. 2), it becomes almost a technical term to describe the
attitude of Donatists to the Catholic sacraments.
