No, 27 (Ep. C)

not think it an unimportant or contemptible thing,
my honoured and well-beloved son, that I ask you
to spare the lives of men whom we pray God to bring
· to repentance. Even setting aside the fact that we
ought not to depart from the eternal principle of
overcoming evil with good,‘² let your Wisdom take
this other fact into account, that no one takes the
trouble to bring Church cases before you, except
churchmen themselx es. So if in such cases 3ou
think fit to put men to death, 3ou u ill deter us from
having anys such cases brought before 3 our tribunal3

and when our opponents ascertain this, they wall
proceed with all the more unrestrained effrontery
to destroy us, when the necessity is laid upon us
of choosing rather to die at their hands than to
hale them before your tribunal to suffer death
themselves. Do not receive m’th contempt, I beg
you, this exhortation, this request, this entreaty
of mine. For Ι (10 not think that you will forget
that, even if you were in a much more exalted posi-
tion than the one you now occupy, and even were I
not a bishop, I might still have had great confidence
in addressing 3ou Meanwhile, let the heretical
Donatists quickl3 learn by your Excellency’s edicts
that the laws passed against their error are still
in force, though they now think that they are of no
effect, and boast that, not even if they were, could
they to any extent spare us. But you will very
greatly assist our labours and perils to bear fruit, if
you strive to repress by the imperial laws that sect
of theirs which is so flaunting and so full of impious
pride, in such a way that they do not appear to
themselves or their supporters to be enduring hard-
ships‚ no matter how slight, for the sake of truth
