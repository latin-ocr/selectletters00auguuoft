No, 10 (Ep. XXIX)

daily evening service a was held and we retired with
the bishop‚ while the brethren repeated hymns there
and a considerable crowd of both sexes remained and
engaged in singing until darkness fell.

I have set forth for you, as briefly as Ι could, what 12
Ι am sure you were anxious to hear. Pray that God
will graciously protect my efforts from proxiding any
cause of offence or any distress. In no small measure
we share with lively warmth of affection in your con-
tentment that such frequent gifts to us from the
spiritually-minded church of Tagaste are intimated.
The ship with the brethren has not yet arrived. At
Asna,b where the priest is brother Argenfflus, the
Circumcellions ⁰ have broken into our church and
smashed the altar. The case is at present being tried 3
we earnestly beg you to pray that the trial may
give no provocation, and may serve, as becomes the
Catholic Church‚ to check the tongue of provocative
heresy. I have sent a letter to the Asiarchfl

May ye remain steadfast in the Lord, brethren,
in all blessedness, and forget us not l Amen.

ἆ The Asiarchs were originally the chief presidents of the
religious rites in the Roman province Asia, whose duties
consisted in giving every year games and theatrical amuse-
ments in honour of the Roman emperor and the gods.
The religious character of the office disappeared with the
establishment of Christianity. The word occurs in Acts
xix. 31 and in the letter of the Church of Smyrna about the
martyrdom of Polycarp. Here the presence of the word is
surprising‚ unless it be either a synonym for ‘⁶ pro-consul''
or a proper name. There is an excellent account of the
pagan Asiarchate in Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, pt. ii.
vol. iii. pp. 404415.
