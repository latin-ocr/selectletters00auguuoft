No, 33 (Ep. CXXVI)

of any kind of fear is a worse thing than the breaking
of that oath, when the actual fear has been removed.
Thanks be to God that the people of Hippo regard 13
his promise towards themselves as being fulfilled if
he comes to the town with the intention of residing in
it, and departs whither necessity calls him with the
purpose of returning. If they were to regard the
letter of his oath and demand its literal fulfilment,
God's servant ought in no wise to depart rather than
in any wise to break his word. Yet, since it would be
crimina} for them so to bind any individual‚ not to
mention a man of his quality, they themselves have
proved that they entertained no other expectation,for
on hearing that he had departed with the promise
of return, they manifested their satisfaction 3 and
fidelity to an oath requires no more and no less than
the performance of what was anticipated from it by
those to whom it was made. What is the use of say-
ing that in taking the oath that he framed with his
own lips, he added a proviso about circumstances that
might necessitate his leaving the town3 the fact is
that with his own lips he again ordered that clause to
be struck out. To be sure, he might have put it in
again when he spoke to the people, but if he had, they
surely would not have made answer, “ Thanks be to
God l ” but would have returned to that protest
which they made when it was read out by the deacon
with the proviso inserted. And does it really affect
the point, whether the excuse of necessity for leaving
the town was inserted or was not? Nothing more
and nothing less was expected from him than what
I mentioned above, and anyone who disappoints the
expectations of those to whom he takes an oath cannot
be anything but a perj urer.
