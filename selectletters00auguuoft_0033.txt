from being symbolical to being anthropomorphic.
Further‚ the Punic religion in its native state had been
more closely akin to the strict monotheism of the

generative, and the female and reproductive. But
around them had grown up no art and no mythology ;

spread, until she was an obj 661 of veneration, not only
in her well—known and beautiful temple at Carthage,
but also in Numidia, Spain, Mauretania, and in Rome
